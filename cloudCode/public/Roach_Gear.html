<p><h6>Advion Roach Bait Gel.</h6>
	<p>Advion Roach Bait Gel is a bait gel designed for bait-resist German roaches as well as other roaches. Use Advion indoors and outdoors as a crack and crevice treatment to control tough infestations.</p>

	<p><h6>How Advion Roach Bait Works</h6>
		<p>Advion Roach Bait Gel by Dupont contains indoxacarb as the active ingredient -- currently the sole member of a new class of chemistry, oxadiazines, which affect insects' nervous systems. After ingesting Advion, the cockroach's own internal enzymes change the molecular structure and attributes of indoxacarb into the more potent MetaActive compound, resulting in paralysis, followed by death.</p>

		<p>Beyond the initial impact, Advion cockroach gel bait provides powerful exponential control of cockroach infestations through secondary kill for complete infestation elimination.</p>

		<p>This cockroach gel bait is formulated such that cockroaches will consume it even in the toughest situations, particularly in gel bait-resistant conditions.</p>

		<p><h6>Treatment Rates for All Uses</h6>
			<p>For heavy infestations of cockroaches, apply 3 to 5 spots of ADVION cockroach gel bait per 10 linear feet.</p>
			<p>For light to moderate infestations of cockroaches, apply 1-3 spots of ADVION cockroach gel bait per 10 linear feet.</p>
<p>Each spot of ADVION gel bait should equal about 0.5 grams (approx. 1/4" diameter)
	For all levels of cockroach infestations, when a bead of ADVION cockroach gel bait is used, apply a small thin bead that is less than 1/8" wide and approximately 2 inches long.</p>
