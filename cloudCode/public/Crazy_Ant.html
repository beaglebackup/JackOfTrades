<h1>Crazy Ant</h1>
<h2>Paratrechina longicornis (Latreille)</h2>
<h2>Subfamily Formicinae</h2>

<p>

<p><strong>Identifying Characteristics.</strong>  "Workers are monomorphic and 2.2 to 3 mm long, with a one-segmented petiole.  They have a slender body with extraordinarily longs legs with antennae (Smith 1965).  The body color is dark brown to black (Smith 1965) with a bluish iridescence (Snelling and George 1979).<p> 
<p><strong>Distribution.</strong>  The crazy ant is tropicopolitan (Sneeling and George 1979), and has been widely distributed by commerce.  It is found sporadically over the entire U.S. (Bennett et al. 1997) and is common along the Gulf Coast, especially Florida (Smith 1965.<p>
<p><strong>Biology and Habits.</strong>  The crazy ant derives its name from  its erractic, jerky movement (Thompson 1990).  According to Blake (1940).  “The colonies are rather small, containing up to 2,000 workers.  There are commonly from eight to 40 queens in each colony.  An entire colony may desert its nest and migrate to another site.” Large colonies numbering tens of thousands have been found living in piles of debris and within landscape mulch in Florida and Texas (Hedges 1997).  Mating flights have been observed, but most new colonies are established by budding (Hedges 1997).<p>
The crazy ant nests in both dry and moist environments, in trash, plants, rotten wood, and soil (Smith 1965).  They also nest adjacent to foundations in landscape mulch behind thick vegetation (Hedges 1997).  Indoors, their nests are located in wall voids, under carpeting, and in potted plants (Hedges 1997).<p>
They have an omnivorous diet, feeding on honey dew, both live and dead insects and various household foods, especially sweets (Smith 1965).”<p>
