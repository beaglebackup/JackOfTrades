MOSQUITO MANAGEMENT</h2></p>


<p>
Mosquitoes are a fact of life in most communities. The level of activity may rise and fall annually depending on weather conditions, but in most normal years mosquitoes appear  in significant numbers in many cities and neighborhoods. Complete elimination of mosquitoes is an impossibility. &quot;Control&quot; of mosquitoes can be defined in many ways  various interested parties. A professional might deem control to be a minimizing of mosquito activity while the public considers one bite to be a failure of the program. It might be best for professionals to designate their efforts as mosquito &quot;reduction&quot; services w:  the expected goal a significant decrease in adult mosquito activity in the targeted are.  Such efforts are accomplished using a combination of strategies, some of which are C  pendent on the individual homeowners for best results.</p>

<p>
Mosquito control is a problem best handled by community and public health agencies rather than by individuals because mosquito-breeding sites are often considerable distances from the places of annoyance. In some states, organized mosquito control is limited or does not exist. Opportunity for commercial and private contract mosquito control arises where state or municipal programs have been shut down, usually for economic reasons, or lack of public support. It is paramount to consult the state pesticide regulatory agency or department of agriculture for local regulations and licensing requirements pertaining to mosquito control. There are some methods, devices and materials that the homeowner and experienced pest management professionals can use to reduce a mosquito pest problem (O&#39;Neill 1997).</p>

<p>
Finding and eliminating existing or potential larval breeding sites, called source reduction, is the most effective strategy to reduce mosquito breeding. William Gorgas uses this strategy in Panama in the early 1900s to reduce yellow fever transmission and the permit the completion of the Panama Canal.</p>

<p>
Wetland management strategies that enhance waterfowl habitats also control mosquitoes (Batzer and Resh 1992). Open marsh water management (OMWM) programs northeast U.S. salt marshes include creating inter-connected ponds to enhance the water flow and fish movement, into potential mosquito breeding areas. Such alteration of tidal circulation enhances mosquito control through fish predation and dramatically reduces need to apply insecticide. If a breeding site cannot be eliminated, routine treatment the a larvicide, pupicide, or introduction of a biological control agent like mosquito fish,  Gambusia spp., can provide control lasting from days to months (O&#39;Neill 1997).</p>

<p>
In parks, backyards, playing fields, picnic areas, and campsites; applying a residual adulticide to surrounding vegetation where mosquitoes rest can offer control for several  days to a week. Larger adult mosquito populations require the use of handheld, vehicle­ mounted, or aircraft-mounted ultra-law-volume (ULV) adulticide application equipment achieve rapid knockdown of mosquitoes over neighborhoods and communities. The open use, calibration, and maintenance of mosquito control equipment was reviewed . the World Health Organization (Anonymous 1990). Environmental mosquito man­agement is an integrated pest management (IPM) philosophy incorporating all available tools and strategies in a systematic approach. Steps of this process include surveillance, identification, trapping, population monitoring, breeding site mapping, larviciding, adulticiding, biological control, source reduction, and modification of breeding habitats .g., OMWM). The myths, often loudly proclaimed to the public by certain activists and product manufacturers, that bats, birds, electric bug zappers, and ultrasonic repelling vices can offer effective mosquito control were reviewed by Mitchell (1993). Such methods have little effect in reducing mosquito attacks around structures.</p>


<p>
<strong>EXCLUSION.</strong> Serious mosquito invasions are seldom seen inside houses protected with strong, tight-fitting wire screens that allow adequate air flow. Laboratory tests with sev­eral mosquito species have shown that 18 x 18 mesh per inch is the coarsest screen that ill exclude adult Ae. aegypti and still allow relatively good ventilation. If a screen's aperture size is larger than 0.0475 inch (1.2 mm), it may not exclude most mosquito species. An even smaller mesh size is needed to screen out black flies and most gnats. If Teens block airflow too much, a building&#39;s occupants may remove or not use them, or may go outside for comfort, defeating the screens&#39; purpose. Screens used over chimneys . flues need to be strong and corrosion-resistant and must be removed when the heating tits are in use (O&#39;Neill 1997).</p>

<p>
Doors and windows with no screens must be kept shut. Large buildings (e.g., ware­houses) with large overhead doorways left open in summer to increase ventilation often have considerable mosquito influx resulting in bites to workers or visitors, especially if the building is located near a body of water or a wooded area. Tight-fitting screen doors installed in all such openings to permit air flow but exclude mosquitoes and other insects the best solution to this problem. Automatic overhead screen doors are commercially available. Air doors are less effective at excluding mosquitoes but can help prevent their movement between sections within a facility (e.g., between receiving and production in a food plant).</p>


<p>
<strong>SOURCE REDUCTION.</strong> Source reduction is an essential part of mosquito control. Mos­quitoes, such as ex. pipiens, Cx. quinquefasciatus, Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, and oth­ers, often breed in the immediate vicinity of buildings. A little effort by the homeowner or building occupants can minimize annoyance and bites caused by such species.</p>

<p>
Water-containing receptacles, such as flowerpots, barrels, metal cans, and automobile tires, should be emptied or discarded, and accumulations of cans or tires should be removed, recycled, or buried in a landfill. Leaking plumbing and air-conditioner overflow that results in the formation of pools on the ground or in areas under a house often SUppOI1 mosquito breeding. Tunnels or underground vaults used by gas, power, and other public utility companies may often have accumulations of water providing a possible source 01 localized mosquito breeding and activity. Other sites that frequently harbor mosquito breeding pools include sewer inlets and catch basins, storm drains and street gutters, roadside ditches, and clogged or defective roof gutters. In rural areas, faulty leaching cesspools may result in the breeding of large numbers of mosquitoes. In all such situa­tions where the condition responsible for the accumulation of water cannot be readily corrected, it is necessary to treat these mosquito-breeding sites with larvicides.</p>

<p>
Old discarded tires are one of the main breeding sites used by mosquitoes in ur­ ban environments. Used tires were likely responsible for the introduc­tion and spread of the Asian tiger mosquito in the United States. Many cities are now addressing the issue of used tires in mos­quito control programs.</p>

<p>
Ornamental garden ponds frequently Fig. 15-12. Discarded tires are a common breed mosquitoes. Mosquito larvae are not source for a number of mosquito species. often found in those ponds stocked with goldfish or top minnows, Gambusia spp. If the fish are not overfed during the mosquito-breeding season, they are more likely to feed on mosquito larvae.</p>

<p>
In large buildings and some homes, basements drain into sumps that must be periodi­cally pumped out. If the water stands long enough and contains enough organic matter, and the ambient temperature remains suitably warm, mosquitoes (mainly Cx. pipiens complex) may breed in such sumps. Sometimes, large populations can occur, breeding nearly year-round, and bite people on upper floors of the building even during winter. If such water-containing sumps and related drains cannot be emptied and thoroughly cleaned out at least weekly, larvicide application may be needed to reduce or eliminate the breed­ing mosquito populations (O&#39;Neill 1997).</p>

<p>
Dense shrubbery of vines around a home provide excellent resting sites for many mosquito species. If such vegetation is removed or pruned to permit sunlight, these har­borages can be eliminated or reduced to a minimum, Several mosquito species, particu­larly in the genera Aedes and Ochlerotaius, breed in tree holes containing water. Such breeding sites CM be permanently eliminated by cleaning out and filling rotten areas in trees. In warmer areas of the U.S., Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus may breed in flower­ pots or their drainage saucers. These saucers should be checked, emptied, brushed out, and rinsed weekly. Mosquitoes can also breed in the water-bearing clay pots that contain smaller, soil-filled pots filled with ornamental plants that might be found in hallways or foyers (O&#39;Neill 1997).</p>

<p>
To eliminate breeding sites of domestic mosquitoes, the homeowner should inspect the premises frequently. All temporary water contain­ers should be removed, holes punched in the bottoms of cans for drainage, or both ends removed and the then flattened. Cesspools, septic tanks, rain barrels, and tubs in which water is stored need to be tightly covered, Open systems should be covered or screened, including their spouts. Bird baths and pans used for watering animals need to be cleaned and the water re­placed each week. Eave troughs should be checked occasionally to see if they are stopped up or sagging, and after rains, flat roofs need to be examined for stand­ing water. Water from a refrigerator or air conditioner should not be allowed to accumulate and stand on the ground, nor should any water be allowed to stand in pools on a property for more than a few days. Rain gutters are especially important as mosquito breeding sites and should be checked regularly to ensure they are clean and that they drain properly. A homeowner should be encouraged to talk to neighbors and local government officials regarding the prevention of mosquito breeding.</p>


<p>
<strong>LARVICIDING.</strong> Larvae may breed wherever suitable water is available. If it is not pos­sible to eliminate this water, other measures must be used. New laws, such as the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (FQPA), have led to significant label changes. Related, Jut unfounded, media sensationalism has heightened public chemophobia, prompting changes in the insecticide choices and the ways these are used for mosquito control. Chemicals available for use as larvicides in the U.S. have been drastically reduced to fenthion (Baytex&quot;), in Florida only, and temephos (Abate&quot;). Temephos in Liquid, granular, and pellet formulations has been an effective tool for many mos­quito abatement programs. Granules are solid particles, O. J to 2.S mm in size, that consist of an inert carrier combined with a technical active ingredient which is released by leaching. Gran­ules are considered safe and easy to use. They allow precise targeting and penetrate vegetation. Abate granules have given prolonged control of Ae. albopictus in used tire piles.</p>


<p>
<h6>Surface Films.</h6> Oils are used to kill larvae, but can also kill pupae. Golden Bear Oil (GB- 1111) has been the standard for more than 20 years, but it cannot be used if fish are present. Agnique&quot; MMF is a monomolecular film that spreads over water surfaces and suffocates mosquito larvae and pupae. It can even kill eggs and emerging adults. It acts the same as oils (e.g., GB-1111) but does not affect fish or plants. A related material, Aqua-Reselin&quot; is used as an adjuvant to help other mosquito control products spread evenly on, and disperse in, water, to make them more effective and quicker acting.</p>


<p>
<h6>Bacteria.</h6> The biological larvicide Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis de Barjac (B.t.i.) was discovered by Goldberg and Margalit (1977). It is safe for non-target organisms and is effective in controlling the larvae of many mosquito species. As B.I. bacteria produce endospores, they also produce a protein crystal in the same cell, beside each spore. 1 protein in these crystals is toxic to certain insects, and each bacterial variety has differ: relative toxicity for different insects. The strain B.t.i. is specific to mosquito larvae. Larvae consume the bacteria as they feed and the ingested toxin penetrates the peritrophic membrane of the gut and poisons the larva in eight to 12 hours. The bacteria may develop from spores and invade the rest of the dead larva&#39;s body. Serotype H-14 of B.I.i. is available as Aquabac.&quot; Bactimos.&quot; LarvXSG,® Teknar,&quot; and Vectobac&quot; in formulations liquid, wettable powder, granules, pellets, and briquets. It has been used effectively many years by many mosquito abatement agencies. Ultraviolet light negatively affect B.I.i. (O&#39;Neill 1997). Becker et al. (1992) reviewed the environmental factors of water temperature, larval density, sunlight. and associated filter feeders that influence effectiveness of microbial agents in mosquito control programs.</p>

<p>
Another bacterial larvicide registered for use overseas in 1992, and first marketed the U.S. in 1995 is Bacillus sphaericus Neide, which has several different strains. F strains isolated from caterpillars or grasshoppers showed no insecticidal activity tow: those insects but did show promise as mosquito larvicides. Sold as vectolex,&quot; B. sphaeru is most effective against Culex species in water with a high organic content, such sewage lagoons or stagnant catch basins. Mosquito larvae feed at different water level (e.g., An. albimanus at the surface; Oc. triseriatus at lower depths). Suspension at different water depths can pose a problem with B. sphaericus, which may affect its efficacy, (O&#39;Neill 1997).</p>


<p>
<h6>Insect Growth Regulators.</h6> The insect growth regulator (IGR) methoprene (Altosid) does not kill mosquito larvae, rather it prevents them from developing into normal adults. Field applications of emulsifiable concentrate of methoprene controlled Oc. nigromaci larvae with as little as 1/80-pound active ingredient per acre, but timing was extremely critical. Larvae had to be treated late in the fourth stage (instar), because the active ingredient persisted only a few hours under field conditions. Altosid&quot; is available as an emulsifiable concentrate formulation and also as several slow-release briquet and pel formulations. Some formulations release effective levels of active ingredient over 30-day or 150-day period (longer if the briquets dry out periodically). Altosid&quot; p lets have given 82% adult emergence inhibition of Culex species in catch basins 15 weeks McCarry (1996). Residual IGR formulations have been successful against developing mosquito larvae in habitats that were difficult to access, monitor, a treat.</p>

<p>
Effective long-term control of Asian tiger mosquitoes in backyard clay flower 00&#39; was achieved with time-release formulations of Altosid&quot; pellets and Abate&quot; Pellets Nasci et al. (1994). Control of this species requires a complete survey to find breed: sites mound structures followed by larviciding or elimination of those breeding sit Classic adulticide programs applying pesticides as thermal fogs or ULV mists in morning or evening have had very limited success against this species, but backyard inspection teams treating with Altosid&quot; pellets have shown promise for control. Candel. and Romanowski (1994) demonstrated aerial application of Altosid&quot; Liquid Larvicide effective against Oc. sollicitans in salt marshes. Altosid&quot; SR20 and Altosid&#39;&quot; Liquid larvicide are routinely applied in fish habitats to successfully control coastal wetlands Aedes and Ochlerotatus species (O&#39;Neill 1997).</p>

<p>
Pyriproxyfen is a new IGR known by the trade names Nylar&quot; and Sumilarv,&quot; It has shown activity against a wide variety of public-health insects, including mosquitoes (Mulla 11. 1989) and chironomid midges (Ali et al. 1993), but it has not yet been registered by : U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for mosquito or midge control.</p>

<p>
Always check products&#39; labels for specific uses and rates. Rates may vary with spe­cific environmental situations (e.g., catch basin, clear water, polluted water), and target species (e.g., Aedes spp. vs Culex spp.). The best source of information regarding the effective use of any larvicide is the product&#39;s manufacturer.</p>


<p>
	<h6>Sonic/Ultrasonic Devices.</h6> A device which emits sound energy in the frequency range of to 36 kilohertz (kHz), in the upper range of human hearing and low range of ultra sound (beyond the ability of many humans to hear), has recently been shown to kill mosquito larvae. This technology is under patent by New Mountain Innovations, Inc., antic, Colli. They currently have one device on the market and at least three others during development or awaiting patent approval. According to the manufacturer, the de­vice gives off sonic energy as a short (less than 15 seconds), minimal energy burst (about 8 Watts); that causes air spaces within each larva to resonate violently enough to seri­ously disrupt internal membranes and organs, quickly killing any larva sufficiently ex­posed. It is claimed to kill all mosquito larvae within a doughnut-shaped (torroid) volume water within 3 feet laterally around the transducer, Affected larvae develop bubbles of , (air) free in their bodies and quickly stop moving.</p>

<p>
The one device currently available gives off its energy through a coated piezo ceramic transducer that can be lowered into water catchments, such as storm drains. The three additional devices under development will each be designed for use ill different settings. One is intended to kill larvae in a 2S-degree, horizontal, wedge-shaped volume of water far as IS feet from the transducer. Another is intended to be towed through shallow ditches of canals by boats, trucks, or ATVs. It will give off about I ,5OO Watts of power j will affect a IS-degree swath. A third type would be custom designed for killing all larvae within fixed water-containing structures like pools or large water holding tanks. These devices are currently relatively expensive (more than $4,000), but may provide totally non-chemical option for killing larvae in certain settings. Although the manufac­turer claims these have no effect on non-target organisms, controlled lab testing against other closely related non-target aquatic insects or other invertebrates has been limited; j there has been only limited field testing so far.</p>


<p>
<strong>ADULTICIDING.</strong> Adulticiding may be the only option available to control invading mos­quitoes such as Ae. vexans or Oc. sollicitans from distant breeding sites outside of com­munity jurisdiction for larviciding. Applying a residual adulticide to shrubs, trees, or ier vegetation around a house where mosquitoes rest can offer control for several days. ch treatments can kill or repel both nights and day-feeding adult mosquitoes resting in : vegetation. Building surfaces treated with such a residual, up to about 6 feet above the
ground and within about 10 feet of any outside light, can similarly kill or repel mosquito adults that are attracted to the light at night. Local breeding adults of Aedes, Culex, Ochlerotatus that rest in culverts. outbuildings, storm drains, cellars, animal shelters, under raised buildings can be killed or repelled by applying a properly labeled insecticide as a thermal fog, aerosol, or Ultra-low-volume (ULV) to all such areas near homes recreation areas.</p>

<p>
Insecticides targeted at controlling adult mosquitoes are mainly applied using three techniques:</p>


<p>
1.) Thermal Aerosols (Fogging). A fog is produced by heating fuel oil in which insecticide [e.g., malathion (Fyfanon&quot;) or naled (Dibrorn&quot;)] is diluted. Disadvantages thermal fogging include hazards of reduced visibility for passing motorists, flammability of the pesticide mixture, cost of the fuel oil carrier, and potential environmental pollution by fuel oil. Once widely used to control adult mosquitoes, this technique has been almost entirely replaced by ULV application.</p>


<p>
2.) Ultra-low-volume (ULV) Application. Special machines are used with nozzles l~ break up undiluted insecticide into microscopic droplets (Fig. 15-14). With ULV application, very small amounts of insecticide are used [2 to 4 ounces per acre (14(l to 280 g per hectare)]. No fuel oil is burned and no smoke comes out of the nozzle. Insecticides applied by ULV include malathion, naled, pyrethrins, resmethrin, and per-methrin (Scourge;&quot; Biornist&quot;).</p>

<p>
Both thermal fogging and ULV applica­tions are temporary in nature. They kill only those adults that come into contact with the droplets, and the droplet cloud quickly disperses. Dosage recommendations are based on flow rate, vehicle speed, and intended swath width. Spray droplets emitted from an application truck or aircraft, particularly urban areas, drift downwind through and between buildings. Variations in air velocity and direction, especially around buildings of different shapes and sizes, will affect t; actual distribution of the insecticide. Penetration into houses is poor, so vectors such as Ae. aegypti, resting inside dwellings will likely not be affected. For maximum efficiency ULV treatments should not be performed when wind speeds exceed 1.7 meters/second Optimum control of mosquitoes is obtained when they are actively flying, usually iJl t; evening, and inversion conditions are probable.</p>

<p>
Initial droplet size of ULV aerosols is generally below 30 microns, so correct formulation of insecticides is essential to prevent their size from decreasing further. The op mum droplet size for adult mosquito control with space treatments or aerosols is a mass median diameter of five to 10 microns (Mount et al. 1975). Undiluted technical malathion
1% active ingredients has been successfully used with this equipment because of its actively low volatility, but flow rate is affected by its viscosity. Specifications for vehicle mounted aerosol machines were published by the WHO (Anonymous 1990). Aerosol cloud dynamics and modeling of aerosol clouds were reviewed by Brown et al. (1996). Treatment for adult mosquito control via ULV should be done only by trained, experi­enced professionals. State or local regulations may restrict such treatments, and some members of a community may object to such treatments. They should be informed and their concerns must be addressed (O&#39;Neill 1997).</p>

<p>
Timing may be critical to success for adulticide applications. Treatments need to be conducted when the target mosquito species are most likely to be active. Table 15-3 (page 1) shows the general times when various key species may be active.</p>


<p>
3.) Mist Blower and Spraying. These methods place insecticide on the foliage of trees, rubs, tall grass, tree trunks, and the sides of structures where resting mosquitoes may contact it. This can kill or repel adult mosquitoes and reduce biting for one to several days places such as parks, backyards, playgrounds, ball fields, or campsites. Dilute insecti­cides may be used including malathion, naled, permethrin, pyrethrins, and resmethrin. D synthetic pyrethroids have been labeled in the U.S. for mosquito larval control due to their high toxicity to fish and other non-target aquatic organisms. Their use is expanding ; barrier or UL V applications to control adult mosquitoes and for impregnation of clothing and bed nets. A combination of ETOC and lambda-cyhalothrin showed high efficacy against organophosphate-resistant adult ex. tarsalis in lab and field trials (Schaefer et al. ~90). A side effect of adult mosquitoes&#39; exposure to pyrethroids can be the loss of their legs from severe shaking (Khoo and Sutherland 1981).</p>


<p><strong>RESISTANCE TO INSECTICIDES.</strong> The resistance of both larvae and adult mosquitoes , insecticides is ever changing. Some species of mosquitoes show resistance to some insecticides while others do not. Further, some of the resistant species may be nonresis­tant in some geographic regions. Resistance to old and new insecticides is being constantly demonstrated by students of mosquito control. The behavior of major genes for insecticide resistance in a population is described by Roush and McKenzie (1987).</p>

<p>
Some strategies for managing insecticide resistance include: (1) manipulation of in­sect population dynamics; (2) influencing of refuges and dispersal; (3) alteration of dos­age rates; and (4) rotation and combinations of different classes of insecticides.</p>

<p>
All insects have the biological capability to develop resistance to all insecticides. The Cx. pipiens complex (probably including molestus) is resistant to all organochlorines &#39;:J.Throughout warmer north temperate regions and also to organophosphate compounds in &quot;ranee, Egypt, and Israel. Culexfatigans is resistant to organochlorines everywhere and also in many places to organophosphates. Species which have demonstrated resistance to ]1 insecticide classes in the U.S. include: Cx. tarsalis, Cr. peus, Oc. nigromaculis, and ?c. melanimon. Other species resistant to at least organochlorines include: Cs. inornata. &#39;:&quot;x. salinarius, Cx. restuans, Ps. columbiae, (plus Oc. cantator, in Canada) (Busvine 1960).</p>

<p>
Field studies confirmed no evidence of resistance to B.t.i. in Ae. vexans populations of the Upper Rhine Valley in Germany even after over 10 years of use. Some experts recommend that susceptibility of mosquito populations should be investigated at least every three years (Becker and Ludwig 1993).</p>


<p>
<strong>INSECTICIDES AND THE ENVIRONMENT.</strong> Carson (1962) wrote a provocative novel about the effect of insecticides on the environment. Many of her statements, though not based on fact, did lead through political action to the almost complete banning of DDT in the U.S. but fortunately not in countries with more rational decision-making processes.</p>

<p>
Mrak (1968), in a more scientifically valid study of pesticides and environmental ef­fects submitted to the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, put the subject of pesticides and the reproductive success of eagles in more accurate perspec­tive. He stated there was reasonable doubt that chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides occurred in the natural food of these birds at levels required to adversely affect reproduc­tion. Another side of the insecticide issue is the viewpoint of farmers and scientists who are trying to feed an ever-growing world population. Borlaug (1971), winner of the 1970</p>






<p>
Nobel Peace Prize, emphasized the continuing value of pesticides not only to save lives nit, through increasing crop yields, to avoid the need to cultivate wildlife lands. Rogers 1972) examined the much-publicized theory that reproductive failures of birds, especially birds of prey, are due to pesticides. He found little evidence for the theory and much evidence against it. Citing the shooting from planes of 500 bald and golden eagles n 1971 in Wyoming and Colorado, he concluded that shooting, collecting of birds and heir eggs, encroachment of suburbia on eagle habitats, accidental electrocution, and dis­turbance of nesting birds by ornithologists were more important factors than pesticides. This conclusion is supported by Audubon Society records showing a progressive decline n eagles years before DDT or other persistent synthetic pesticides were ever used.</p>


<p>
<strong>CONTROL BY FISH.</strong> Top-feeding minnows, particularly Gambusia affinis (Baird &amp; :Jirard), are often placed in ornamental ponds and pools to control mosquito breeding (Fig. 15-15). These fish occur naturally in the South and thrive where winters are not too severe. Females measure about 2.5 inches (6.3 cm) in length with males about 1.5 inch (3.8 cm). Their eggs hatch within the female&#39;s body, usually producing six to 10 in a brood and one to five broods per year. Younger fish feed on algae, plankton, and similar organisms. Older fish eat mosquito larvae and adults, as well as other aquatic insects. They can prey on mosquito
larvae in shallow water less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) in depth, a favorite breeding habitat of some mosquitoes, and can effectively control mosquitoes in some, but not all situations (O&#39;Neil] 1997).</p>

<p>
Water-level management can directly affect mosquito populations by stranding larvae along the shoreline, exposing them to top-feeding minnows and other predators. Remov­ing vegetation along a shore can kill some larvae by wave action and further expose them to predators. The presence of a large fish population in potential breeding sites may help control Oc. taeniorhynchus by inhibiting their oviposition. Rupp (1996) reviewed the pros, cons, and environmental impacts of Gambusia for mosquito control.</p>

<p>
Other fish species have been tried for their potential in mosquito control. Guppies, Poecilia reticulata Peters, and Tilapia spp. have been the most successful. Species of Zacco, Aplocheilus, and Oryzias have also been studied for this purpose (Haas and Pal 1984).</p>


<p>
<strong>REPELLENTS.</strong> In a properly screened building, mosquito repellents are seldom needed. When it is &quot;bug season,&quot; people may not be able to stay long on an unscreened porch or the immediate surrounding area due to biting insects. Seaside areas, summer camps and cabins, and similar places are often notable for hordes of blood-feeding insects. In such locations, effective repellents and toxicants can be invaluable. Most repellents act upon contact and keep the insect from biting when it touches the protective chemical coating with its mouthparts. Some repellents may be sufficiently volatile so the insects do not
come close to the skin coated with the vaporizing chemical.</p>

<p>
Some currently available repellent liquids and creams offer protection for several hours against biting insects. The most obvious imperfection of current formulations is the need to apply the repellent on all exposed body surfaces, particularly when large numbers biting insects are present.</p>

<p>
A good repellent should remain effective over a relatively long period of time again one or more biting pests, such as mosquitoes, flies, fleas, or ticks. It should be relative stable chemically and should not readily evaporate, although some degree of volatility may be essential. For skin applications, it should be non-irritating and easy to apply hand. It also needs to be relatively insoluble in water to resist loss by sweating and be resistant to being rubbed off (abrasion) as possible. It should not have an objectionable feel, smell, or appearance (e.g., oily, greasy); should not stain clothing; and should 1 dissolve or mar organic or synthetic surfaces (e.g., paints, plastics).</p>

<p>
Repellents usually are applied to skin by shaking a few drops of liquid or squeezing small portion of cream into the palms of the hands, rubbing them together; then smearing the repellent over exposed skin and unexposed places such as ankles, shoulders, a shoulder blades. Aerosol sprays are a very popular way to apply repellents. Summer clothes, particularly when wet by perspiration, offer little protection against biting sects. Where chiggers (mites) and ticks cause annoyance, it usually is necessary to apply the repellent material lightly over socks, clothing, and such places as the neckbands, fly and trouser cuffs.</p>

<p>
Some disadvantages of many current repellents include: (1) they may cause irritation particularly if they get into the eyes or on mucous membranes; (2) they must be reapply every few hours; (3) they are not effective against all biting insects, ticks, or mites; they may dissolve paints, plastics (e.g., synthetic watch crystals), and synthetic fib (rayon, etc.); and (5) some people may be sensitive or allergic to them.</p>

<p>
Field evaluation of repellents against mosquitoes usually involves application to arm or leg of a human subject, then exposing the treated surface(s) to the target species Protection afforded by a repellent is determined by the time in minutes to the first bite these treated areas and is designated as the repellent time of the material under test. Biting frequency is another measure, and is indicated by recording the bites per min on treated versus corresponding untreated (control) areas or test subjects.</p>

<p>
Travis (1950) reported that factors which cause variation in repellent test results elude: (l) repellents are more durable on some subjects than others; (2) different spec of mosquitoes are not equally repelled by the same repellent; (3) different broods of same mosquito species vary in their reaction to the same repellent; (4) different samples of a chemical vary in their repellency; (5) perspiration reduces repellent time; (6) 1 biting rates (or small biting populations) can lengthen repellency time; and (7) mosquitoes are sometimes more avid in their biting when first disturbed.</p>

<p>
Some available repellents or repellent combinations are fairly effective. They were the most part widely used by the armed forces and have been accepted by the pub O&#39;Neill (1997) listed several articles on repellents, from specific research and apply tests to general reviews. Citronella, a popular old standby, has been generally replaced more effective repellents. Some essential oils or plant extracts (e.g., eucalyptus oil) have repellency, but are not as effective or long lasting as often claimed. One of the most effective repellents is N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzrunide (formerly I\,N-diethyl-m­ luamide; or DEET) which was discovered in 1954 and is still considered by mosquito perts as the &quot;gold standard&quot; of mosquito repellents throughout the world. DEET repel­lents were widely used by U.S. military personnel during the Vietnam War.</p>

<p>
Two piperidine isomers, both currently being processed for patents pending refereed journal publication of their test results and subsequent commercial release, are the first chemicals to have ever shown comparable repellency to DEET. They are both expected reach the market within a year. One other chemical derived from tomato plants, or their wild relatives, has been claimed (by its developers) to also be comparable to DEET; but its research results have not yet been made available to other scientists in the mosquito and repellency basic research community (Klun 2002).</p>

<h6>Common Repellents.</h6> Repellents most commonly used by pest management profes­sionals and the public include:</p>


<p>
Dimethyl Phthalate. Dimethyl phthalate is a colorless and practically odorless liquid &#39;with a specific gravity of 1.19. It is only 0.5% soluble in water or mineral oil.</p>


<p>
Dimethyl Carbate. Dimethyl carbate (Dimethyl cis-bicyclo[2,2,1]-5-heptane-2,3- icarboxylate), also called dimethyl endolene or dimelone, is a white crystalline solid with a melting point of about 104°F (40°C). It has a mild, pleasant odor and is soluble in indalone and dimethyl phthalate.</p>


<p>
Indalone. Indalone (ButyI3,4-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-4-oxo-2H-pyran-6-carboxylate) is a light yellow to reddish brown liquid with a mild odor and a specific gravity of 1.056 to 1.062.</p>


<p>
DEET. DEET or N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (formerly N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) s a liquid repellent with a broad range of effectiveness. It is one of the best repellents against mosquitoes, fleas, biting flies, chiggers, and ticks. United States Department of Agricultural chemists first synthesized this repellent in 1954. The technical grade contains 70 to 75% N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide. The meta isomer is the most repellent. Ibis chemical does not have to be mixed with other repellents; however, it is usually diluted in ethanol or other alcohols.</p>

<p>
Women are usually protected by DEET for a longer period than men. Sweat and car­bon dioxide were found not to result in loss of effectiveness of DEET. Differences in protection times between repellents appear to be due mainly to differences in their mini­mum effective dose and secondarily to differences in the rate of loss, where resistance to loss by abrasion (rubbing off) can be very important (Smith et al. 1963; O&#39;Neill 1997). Holoway et al. (1967) showed that standard DEET repellent could not be detected by smell by mosquitoes from more than 12 inches (30 cm) away.</p>

<p>
DEET is resistant to removal by Tubbing, perspiration, 1U1d water. It may be applied as it lotion, an aerosol, or pressurized spray to both the skin and clothing. Care should be taken to avoid contact with the eyes or the lips. DEET may affect certain synthetic fibers,</p>





<p>
plastics, and painted or varnished surfaces.</p>

<p>
Additives have been used for many years to extend the effectiveness of repellents.</p>

<p>
Polymeric additives act by forming thin films that incorporate and slowly release the active ingredient in a vapor phase. Microencapsulated and microparticle systems have recently been evaluated as controlled-release repellent formulations (Gupta and Rutledge 1989). These formulations release the active ingredient from the surface and/or interior spaces of the capsules or particles. The performance of DEET was greatly enhanced by both polymer and microcapsule formulations in tests against Ae. aegypti and An. albimanrs (Rutledge et al. 1996).</p>

<p>
Research by the U.S. Army and 3MD1 Company from 1984 to 1989 resulted in the develop­ment of an extended-release cream formulation containing 35% DEET in a polymer, which is currently used by various branches of the U.S. military and is also available commercially.</p>


<p>
Permethrin. Permethrin was recently adopted by the U.S. Department of Defense for wide-scale use as a fabric impregnant because it has repellent effects against many biting arthropods, including mosquitoes. Perrnethrin applied to clothing by aerosol, or impreg­ nation, has become the preferred repellent for mosquitoes (Harbach et al. 1990), ticks (Evans et al. 1990), and chiggers (Frances et al. 1992). Fryauff et al. (1996) reported [0 significant reduction in knockdown and mortality of Culex spp. and sand flies after repeated washings of pennethrin-impregnated military uniform fabric. Permethrin also \VIS shown to be a good tent fabric treatment, giving protection from bites greater than 96&quot;fc, for nine months (Schreck 1991).</p>


<p>
Neem Oil. Neem oil caused an anti-feedant effect in 26 insect species tested (Ladd et .l. 1978). When mixed with coconut oil and applied to human skin, 2% neem oil protected against all Anopheles spp. tested for 12 hours (Sharma et al. 1993). Neem oil is mechanically extracted from neem tree seeds, Azadirachia indica (A. Juss) (family Meliacee) and is edible after processing (O&#39;Neill 1997).</p>


<p>
Coconut 0 i I Extract. Coconut oil extract from flowers of the woody weed plant, Lantaa camara (L.) (family Verbenaceae) gave more than 94.5% biting protection for up to fer hours against Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti (Dua et al. 1996). This biting protection &quot;IS greater than the percentage protection reported for neem oil against Aedes under similar field conditions (Sharma et al, 1995).</p>


<p>
Citrosa Oil. A plant recently introduced into North America as the citrosa, Pelargonim citrosum (VaJ1 Leenii) and widely marketed as a biological mosquito repeLlent has been demonstrated to be a failure by Cilek and Schreiber (1994). Confirmation of lack of repellency by the plant was made by Cummings and Craig (1995), and no repellency was found in the essential oil of citrosa by Matsuda et al. (1996).</p>


<p>
Other Repellents. McGovern and Schreck (1988) tested 143 hydroxyesters on cloth ad some provided extremely long repellency - two were repellent for 2.7 and 3.9 yes. Curtis et al. (1989) reviewed a variety of synthetic and natural repellents for biting insects. Excessive use of insecticides in repellents may cause harmful physical results, especially on people who are sensitive or allergic (Liu et al. 1987).</p>

<p>
Interesting research recently has been published about the use of air movement (e.g., from fans) as a technique to prevent mosquitoes from biting persons within an area of low-velocity air flow [e.g. l.7m/second (5 mph) to 2.5 m/second (8 mph)] and the enhancing effects of adding very small amounts of DEET to such air flow (Hoffmann and
Miller 2003).</p>


<p>
<h6>Mosquito Removal Traps.</h6> In the past few years, special traps have been developed, tested, and marketed that are intended to strongly attract all mosquitoes seeking a blood meal and catch them, thus removing them from a fairly wide radius around the trap. Currently, at least five such brand named traps (e.g., Mosquito Delete.&quot; Dragonfly.&quot; Black Mantis&quot;) are available, and several are being relabeled and sold under the names of large retailers. These traps all are based on catalytic breakdown of propane (often from a 20- pound tank) into water vapor and carbon dioxide, which is slightly heated during the reaction. These warm vapors, as well as one of several specific chemicals (e.g., l-octen- 3-01) known to attract certain biting insects, provide a very strong attraction for biting insects, especially mosquitoes, over relatively long distances (e.g., 100 feet or farther &quot;down­ wind&quot; from the trap). Some of these traps also have a dim, flickering light, a fan (to suck the insects into some collection chamber or bag), or a sticky surface (glueboard)
to catch attracted insects.</p>

<p>
Several of these traps claim to &quot;cover&quot; or &quot;protect&quot; about a l20-foot radius around the
trap in still air. They should be much more attractive for host-seeking insects than a human, assuming the trap and person are both at equal distances from the insect when first detected. They can only be effective when they are operating correctly, properly maintained, and properly placed. The odor plume, or area from which they draw host seeking mosquitoes, can be strongly affected (in both size and shape) by even a slight breeze. A human who is downwind of such a trap could be &quot;found&quot; and bitten by mosqui­toes that were attracted toward that trap (often from long distances). The total number of such events could be greater than if there had been no such trap in use (e.g., such traps will draw in many more mosquitoes, from a much greater area, than would normally find their way to the same spot if the trap were not operating). Sticky-type trap surfaces must be checked often and changed when they begin to fill with insects. Such traps are about the same size as, and some look similar to, a backyard gas grill. These traps are currently expensive, many are more than $500 (U .S.) each. They have no effect at all when they are not operating, so to competitively draw both day-biting and night-biting mosquitoes away from nearby people, they would have to run constantly. Several of these traps are mar­keted in parallel with smaller devices that dispense a repellent such as citronella oil (some claim to repel biting pests within a 1O-foot radius). This joint marketing is apparently based on the idea of placing repellent units near humans to keep mosquitoes away at close range, and placing the large attractant traps where they will draw mosquitoes away at the same time (i.e., a combined &quot;push and pull&quot; effect). Practical integration of such traps into local mosquito management (biting reduction or prevention) programs is still
in the experimental stage.</p>
