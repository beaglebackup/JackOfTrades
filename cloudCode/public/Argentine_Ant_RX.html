“Pest management of ants requires a systematic approach.  The professional draws on his or her knowledge of the biology and habits of each species to determine the most effective control strategy for a particular infestation.<p>
The first step is to identify the pest ant.  A 10X to 30X magnifier is usually sufficient for identifying most species.  For those ants that are more difficult to identify, a specimen for identifying most species.  For those ants that are more difficult to identify, a specimen should be collected for observation with a binocular dissecting microscope.  For this purpose, ants can be collected in small vials containing 70% isopropyl alcohol as a preservative.<p>  
Several good references for identifying structural pest ants are:
1.	PCT Field Guide for the Management of Structure-Infesting Ants (Hedges 1998).
2.	Urban Entomology (Ebeling 1975).
3.	Scientific Guide to Pest Control (Bennett et al. 1997).
4.	NPCA Field Guide to Structural Pests (Smith and Whitman 1992).
5.	House-Infesting Ants of the Eastern United States (Smith 1965).
6.	Structure-Invading Ants of Florida (Vail et al. 1994).
7.	Identification and Habits of Key Ant Pests of Washington (Workers and Winged Reproductives) (Akre and Antonelli 1992).<p>

<p>Identifying the species of ant will assist the professional in finding nests, entry points, and signs of infestation.  For example, pavement ants nest in soil, and workers often enter buildings through expansion joints or cracks in a slab.  With carpenter ants, the parent nest is often located outside in a tree or stump.  In addition to finding nests, the conditions contributing to the infestation should be determined.  In this regard, every inspection should begin with an interview of the client who can often provide valuable information about the infestation.<p>
To locate nests and areas of activity, prebaiting with drops of honey and diced insects (crickets or mealworms) on white index cards placed wherever ants are found can be helpful.  Most ants are attracted one or both of these foods, and when they discover it will return to the nest to recruit other ants.  By tracking homing ants, the professional can obtain valuable information on possible nest sites and entry points into a structure.<p>
In addition to foraging ants, other signs of infestation can be helpful.  Finding alates indoors generally indicates an interior nest.  Alates will frequently be found around windowsills because they tend to fly toward light after exiting the nest.  During nest construction, ground-dwelling ants deposit excavated soil outside of the nest, and carpenter ants and velvety tree ants leave their traces in the form of sawdust or chewed insulation.<p>
The long term success of a pest management program for ants often depends on the client being adequately instructed on key points of pest ant biology, detection, and contributing factors including:
<ul>
	<li>(a)	Poor sanitation.</li>
	<li>(b)	Moisture damage arising from inadequate ventilation, earth-to-wood contact, clogged or overflowing gutters, and leaky pipes.</li>
	<li>(c)	Cracks in a foundation or superstructure.</li>
	<li>(d)	Composition and depth of landscape mulch (Jordan and Jones 2003).</li>
	<li>(e)	Stacked or piled lumber, bricks, stones, leaf litter, and other debris.</li>
	<li>(f)	Ornamental plants infested with homopteran insects (e.g., aphids).</li><p>
<p>To achieve long-term control and prevent reinfestation, these contributing factors should be corrected.<p>

<p>After the extent of the infestation and location of the colony or colonies involved is known, three strategies may be employed:
<ul>
	<li>1.	Habitat Modification – Environmental modification, so that the pest can no longer survive.  An example would be repairing a leaky pipe or eliminating a source of food that may be attracting the ants.</li><p>
	<li>2.	Mechanical Methods – Steps taken to exclude ants or remove potential harborages, such as trimming or removing vegetation adjacent to a building, or caulking potential entryways.</li><p>
	<li>3.	Chemical Treatments – Use of residual insecticides and baits, e.g., dusting a void, drenching mounds, or using baits.</li><p>
</ul>
<p><strong>APPLICATION OF RESIDUAL INSECTICIDES.</strong>  Ant control requires a broad-based treatment strategy that often includes residual insecticides.<p>

<p><strong>COLONY TREATMENT.</strong>  Residual insecticides are most effective when applied directly to the nest.  The choice of formulation and product depends on the treatment site:<p>

<h4>Voids.</h4>  Ants nesting within structural voids can be treated with a dust or aerosol formulation.  To gain access into a void, a hold may be drilled or a pre-existing point of entry can be used.  A bulb duster is generally sufficient for treating a localized infestation.  For more extensive infestations, a larger hand duster (e.g., B&amp; G’s Mini-Dust-R) would be more suitable.   Dusts should be applied in a light, thin layer.  Otherwise, they become repellent to ants.  Insulated voids are best treated using a residual aerosol product or an insecticide applied with an Actisol or Micro-Injector.  A satellite nest of carpenter ants located under insulation in an attic can be removed by vacuuming, followed by a spot treatment with a wettable powder insecticide to kill nay ants from the main colony that later visit the nest site (Hedges 1997).<p>

<h4>Wood.</h4>  Ants nesting inside structural timbers, landscape logging, and fence posts can be treated by drilling and injecting a dust, aerosol, or a water-based product.  Such formulations may also be applied to nests in tree holes, stumps, or logs.<p>

<h4>Soil.</h4>  Ant colonies nesting in lawns, landscape beds, or under objects such as stones and landscape logging, can be drenched with a few ounces of a water-based insecticide labeled for this purpose.  For large mounds, such as those constructed by red imported fire ants or field ants, as much as a gallon or more of insecticide might be necessary.<p>

<h4>Landscape Mulch.</h4>  Mulches can reduce the effectiveness of a water-based treatment due to the quantity of liquid needed to penetrate through the mulch (Bello 1997).  Consequently, when a water-based insecticide is applied only to the surface, it is rarely effective.  Instead, when numerous colonies in mulch offer, the mulch should be raked back to expose the ant colonies and then treated.  The surface may also be treated after the mulch is raked back into place.<p>

<h4>Slab Foundations.</h4>  Ants nesting under a slab foundation and foraging or releasing alates into a building are often difficult to control due to their inaccessibility.  In this case, baits would be the preferred treatment.  If the ants are not attracted to the bait, the slab can be drilled in order to treat the soil.  Typically, a termiticide labeled for treatment under slab foundations can be used.  A number of holes may be necessary because where the ants are emerging from under the slab is not  necessarily the location of the nest.  In some cases, application of the termiticide as a foam may be helpful.  Cracks in the slab can be sealed to prevent alates from entering the rooms above.<p>

<h4>Stacks of Material.</h4>  Ants nesting within the spaces formed by stacks of lumber, bricks, or other material generally require that the items be unstacked in order to expose colonies for treatment with a water-based formulation.<p>

<p><strong>PERIMETER TREATMENTS.</strong>  General application around the perimeter of a building using a residual water-based or granular formulation can be an effective treatment for ants.  Currently (2003), a number of pyrethroids and the termiticide, Termidor, can be used for perimeter treatments to deter invasions of many pest ants.<p>

The label should be consulted for the correct application rate for a perimeter treatment.  For example, some products permit a barrier up to 10 feet from the foundation.  As of 2003, however, the Termidor label restricts treatment to 1-foot bands on the ground and up the foundation using 1.5 gallons of finished spray per 1,000 square feet.  In addition, Termidor can only be applied twice per year.  Perimeter treatments are most effective when combined with treatment of nests on the property, as well as any active or suspected ant trails (Rust et al. 1996).<p>

Depending on the insecticide and formulation, barriers have difference degrees of contact activity and repellency (Knight and Rust 1990).  Some pyrethrouid formulations are highly repellent to ants, often creating additional problems when ants indoors are cut off from their outdoor colonies.  The trapped ants may increase their activity inside searching for an escape route, thus increasing their visibility to the building’s occupants.  At the other end of the spectrum are the synthetic pyrethroids like Talstar, which are not repellent but highly toxic, and control ants by suppressing recruitment (Richman and Hooper-Bui 2003).  In addition, perimeter treatments with nonrepellent insecticides may act more like baits than barriers, allowing the ants to pick up the insecticide and distribute it to the colony (Vail et al. 2003).<p>

Creating effective barriers is difficult because any small gap provides a potential passageway for ants.  A number of additional factors also reduce the effectiveness of barriers (Rust et al. 1996), including chemical degradation, irrigation, dense groundcover, mulches, high temperature, substrate alkalinity, and direct sunlight.  From an environmental perspective, one drawback to perimeter treatments is their broad-spectrum effect, which may kill beneficial arthropods, resulting in secondary pest outbreaks (Smith et al. 1996).<p> 

<p><strong>APPLICATION OF BAITS.</strong>  Although ant baits have had a long history in pest control, there is renewed interest in their development and use.  This new popularity is due to public pressure to reduce pesticide use, new insecticides well-suited for bait formulation, and the numerous advantages of using baits: (1) baits are more target specific than contact insecticides; (2) baits are more cost-effective compared than labor-intensive inspections to locate nests (which are often unsuccessful) and treatment strategies that involve invasive techniques like drilling and dusting; and (3) baits can be used in sensitive places such as commercial kitchens and food preparation areas, and around electrical equipment.  On the negative side, baits tend to be slower acting than sprays or dusts.  Therefore, the professional needs to educate a client about how baits work and the amount of time it takes to obtain control with them.<p>

<p><strong>BAIT FORMULATION AND COMPOSITION.</strong>  Baits are formulated as liquids, discrete solid matrices (including gels), and granules (Silverman and Roulston 2003).  Liquid is an ideal formulation for many pest ants that have coevolved with honeydew-producing insects.  A bait must attract ants and be palatable, so that it is consumed and shared with other ants.  Other materials added to the bait, such as emulsifiers, preservatives, and waterproofing or antimicrobial agents must also be palatable.  The toxicant must have delayed activity to ensure a widespread distribution in the colony.  If it is too fast acting, recruitment and trophallaxis will break down and the active ingredient will not be sufficiently transferred (Rust et al 2002).<p>

Insect growth regulators (IGRs) and metabolic inhibitors are two frequently used bait toxicants.  IGRs work slowly, interfering with larval development, caste differentiation, and reproduction of the queen.  Compared with IGRs, metabolic inhibitors work relatively fast by interfering with cellular respiration.<p>
