<h1>Firebrats</h1>

<p>“Silverfish
and firebrats belong to what is thought to be one of the most
primitive of living insect orders, which in older texts is known as
the Thysanura (Labaneira et al. 1988) and in newer classifications as
order Zygentoma (Arnett 2000).  This order is characterized by the
three long tail-like appendages arising from the tip of the abdomen,
which is responsible for this group’s common name – bristletails
(also called fishmoths, tasseltails, or fringetails).  They have
chewing mouthparts, long antennae, and the body is nearly always
covered with scales.  While some Thysanura are humped in the thorax,
silverfish and firebrats are more flattened.  Viewed from the top,
these insects have a carrot-shaped outline.</p>

<p>The
structure-invading silverfish and firebrats are usually placed into a
single family, the Lepismatidae, of which 13 species occur in the
U.S. and Canada (Arnett 2000).  Within this family, three genera are
the most commonly encountered: Lepisma and Ctenolepisma for the
silverfishes, and Thermobia for the firebrat (Sweetman and Kulash
1944).  Though Wygodzinsky (1991) illustrated 11 thysanurans that
have been found in foods or in building, the important house and
apartment-dwelling silverfish in North America are Lepisma saccharina
Linnaeus, the common silverfish; Ctenolepisma longicaudata Escherich
(=Urbana Slabaugh), gray or longtailed silverfish; Ctenolepisma
lineata (Fabricius), the fourlined silverfish; and Thermobia
domestica (Packard), the common firebrat.</p>

<p>In
size, silverfish range from about ½ inch (12 mm) in the common
silverfish to about ¾ inch (18 mm) in the gray silverfish.  Two
rather long, segmented antennae protrude from the head of all
described species of silverfish and from the firebrat.  The
firebrat’s antennae extend beyond the tip of the abdomen, often
curved back toward the rear of the insect.</p>

<p>The
common silverfish has scales with a metallic steel-gray sheen.  Gray
silverfish have their bodies covered with dull silver- to
gray-scales.  The fourlined silverfish has patches of dark and light
gray scales arranged in four dark lines running down the back.  The
common firebrat may appear slightly silvery but usually appears
mottled with patches of light and dark scales.  Both silverfish and
firebrats are capable of swift movement, and silverfish are known for
their ability to move sideways or even jump when disturbed (Elizinga
1981).  Since the bodies of these insects are flattened, they can
find harborage in very small cracks or crevices, even within the
confines of narrow book bindings, the loose pages of books, or in the
corrugations of cardboard.</p>

<p>Silverfish
and firebrats mature through the development process known as
ametabolous metamorphosis.  The newly hatched silverfish nymphs look
like tiny adults except that the characteristic body scales do not
usually appear until at least the third molt.  The number of times
that silverfish or firebrats molt has not been agreed upon.  They may
be like other primitive arthropods that continue to molt throughout
their life span since the firebrat has been observed to shed its skin
more than 60 times during a period of two to three years (Sweetman
1938).  
</p>

<p><strong>Feeding Habits and Damage.</strong> Some aspects of their behavior, particularly
feeding behavior, should be understood so as to optimize the
development of a strategy to control these insects when they become
structural pests.  The feeding habits of the major species of
silverfish are very similar.  These insects may roam for some
distance in search of food, but once they have found a satisfactory
source, they remain close to it.</p>

<p>Silverfish
consume both carbohydrates and proteins.  Adams (1933) showed T.
domestica was extremely fond of rolled oats and ground, dried beef. 
Sweetman (1939) noted L. saccharina preferred proteins to
carbohydrates.  Moreover, he found this insect to be cannibalistic,
eating cast skins and dead and injured individuals.  
</p>

<p>Observations
of the damage done by T. domestic to fabrics and papers showed that
the greatest damage was done to medium typewriter bond paper,
regenerated cellulose – either knitted or plain weave – and
linen.  Cotton and silk were attacked when the texture was suitable
for feeding.  Mallis (1941), working with C. longicaudata, found this
silverfish fed on materials of both animal and vegetable origin,
including what flour, whether or not it contained sugar or salt. 
Silverfish are extremely fond of flour and starch; this fondness, in
part, accounts for their not infrequent appearance in breakfast
cereals.</p>

<p>Silverfish
are pests of paper, particularly paper with a glaze on in.  They are
especially fond of the sizing in paper, which may consist of starch,
dextrin, casein, gum, flue.  These insects often attack wallpapers,
in which they may eat holes or remove the paste, which eventually
causes the paper to become detached from the wall.  According to
Lindsay (1940), only the starch and dextrin sizes in the wallpaper
are attacked extensively and the pigment has little effect on the
nature of the attack.  Mallis (1941) found in experimenting with the
paper preferences of C. longicaudata that such paper as cleansing
tissue, onion skin, and cellophane (cellophane is almost pure
cellulose) are preferred by this silverfish, whereas papers such as
used for newsprint (printed or unprinted), cardboard, and brown
wrapping paper are not eaten.  As a rule, books and papers that are
in constant use are damaged little, but even these items may show
ragged edges and markings on the bindings.</p>

<p>Lindsay
(1940) noted the gray silverfish readily eats artificial silk and
cotton, but does not touch wools or true silks.  Mallis (1941) found
under natural conditions that the gray silverfish will feed upon
textiles of plant origin such as linen, rayon, cotton, and lisle. 
Linen is by far the preferred plant fiber.  Wall (1953) noted the
firebrat and fourlined silverfish feed upon carpets made with viscose
rayon.  Brett’s (1962) studies demonstrated that the firebrat
prefers rayon to acetate.  The feeding by gray silverfish upon the
fibers of animal origin, such as silk or wool, is practically
negligible.</p>

<p>Damage
by silverfish to textile may be recognized by the presence of feces,
scales, irregular feeding marks on the individual fibers of the
textile, and, in certain instances, especially in the case of linens,
by yellowish stains.  Where damage to textiles is believed to be due
to silverfish, a card coated with flour paste may be placed in the
vicinity.  Subsequent examination for feeding marks upon the card
will reveal whether silverfish are present.</p>

<p>Accumulations
behind moldings apparently provide the insects with a varied diet. 
Where silverfish are found in and around rugs and carpets they are
probably feeding upon crumbs of food that may be in the vicinity. 
Reports of these in carpets of “powder” rooms may be the result
of spillage of cornstarch-based facial powders.  Lasker (1957)
demonstrated that the fourlined silverfish, which is commonly found
among wooden roof materials and wall voids, produces the enzyme
cellulose in its midgut which allows it to digest cellulose.  Lindsay
(1940) stated C. longicaudata does not drink liquids, but instead
obtains its moisture from food and the metabolic oxidation of
foodstuffs.  The insect derives part of its moisture from the
atmosphere and excretes dry feces.</p>

<p>Silverfish
are extremely resistant to starvation and may be kept alive in a
glass jar without food and water for weeks.  Lindsay (1940) found
that one adult out of 20 survived for 307 days without food.  She
also observed cellulose-digesting bacteria as well as fungal hyphae
in the crop of the gray silverfish.</p>

<p>Some
species of silverfish can be very resistant to high temperatures and
low relative humidities.  Silverfish have been found living in attics
where temperatures have been known to reach 130*F(54*C) with relative
humidities of less than 15% moisture.  The author has noted the homes
most severely infested with silverfish tend to be those with wooden
shake roofs.  Such homes in Kansas City and ST. Louis can support
large silverfish populations likely due to the surface fungi that
survives under and between wooden shakes.”</p>
