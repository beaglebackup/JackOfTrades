<h1>Black Widow Spiders</h1>
<h2>Widow Spiders, Latrodectus spp. (Theridiidae).</h2>

<p>
“No other group of spiders causes
so much apprehension than do the black widow spiders and their close
relatives. The taxonomic status of widow species in the United
States has been under dispute for some time.  
</p>

<p><strong>Distribution.</strong>
 Widow spiders are present in every state in the United States, in
southern Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, Central and South America,
Mediterranean countries, southern Russia, New Zealand, Australia, and
warmer parts of the world.  They are frequently found in railroad
boxcars, ship holds, and interstate freight vans.  In northern
states, outbreaks or “blooms” of black widows occur periodically.
 Apparently, alternating warm spells and cold snaps in the winter and
spring are detrimental to survival.  In much of California, the
Southwest and the Southeast, widows are highly common, even in desert
cities where irrigation in present.  The brown widow was recently
discovered in California (Vetter 2003a).</p>

<p><strong>Life History.</strong>  Eggs are
laid in silken sacs up to ½ inch (13 mm) in diameter, and a female
may produce four to nine egg sacs during one summer.  About 300 to
400 eggs per sac is common, although Lawson (1933) reported one sac
with 917 eggs.  The female guards the egg sacs and moves them as
necessary to repair her web.  After laying eggs, the females are
hungry and are more likely to bite if the web is distributed.  The
eggs generally hatch in eight to 10 days; however, the period between
the egg deposition and spiderling emergence may be two to four weeks.
 After emerging, second instar spiderlings remain near the sac, but
after a few hours or days, the climb to a high point, spin a stand of
silk to catch the wind, and are “ballooned” away to try their
survival at another location.</p>

<p>Depending
upon the availability of prey, sexual maturity occurs in about four
months after seven additional molts.  In warmer climates, development
continues throughout the year, but one generation per year is
standard.  In northern areas, winter is spent in pre-adult stages
with mating occurring around May and egg-laying following shortly
thereafter.  Deevey and Deevey (1945) found the average male matures
in about 71 days after emergence from the egg sac and lives about 179
days longer.  The maximum longevity was 160 days for males and 550
for females.  Kaston (1948) reported to survival of one female for
1,063 days (nearly three years) after emergence from the egg sac.</p>

<p><strong>Mating.</strong>
 Contrary to popular belief, males are seldom devoured by the female
after mating.  Ross and Smith (1979) suggested males and females have
chemoreceptive hairs on the tarsi and pedipalps and complementary
contact pheromones incorporated into the silk.  These substances
function in mate location, sex identification, and courtship.  Web
vibration by the male and reciprocating movements by the female
initiate the courtship, but the ferocity of the female towards her
mate has been much overplayed.  Actually, males live much longer when
associated with a mate because he acts as a “parasite,” feeding
on prey captured by the female.</p>

<p><strong>Recognition of Widow Spiders.</strong> 
The southern black widow spider Latrodectus mactans, is perhaps the
most well-known spider in North America.  The adult female is usually
jet black above with two reddish triangular markings, joined to form
an “hour glass” shape on the underside of the abdomen.  The red
markings may also appear as spots on the underside of the abdomen or
extend as a row over the top of the abdomen.  Mature females are
nearly ½ inch (13 mm) in body length and males are about half this
size.  The markings of immature spiderlings and mature males are
similar.  Young black widows are orange and white and acquire more
black in each successive molt.  One or two red markings may be
present underneath, but these may be quite variable and are not
usually joined.  The males have whitish streaks, bars, or dots on the
dorsal surface of the abdomen and two triangular red markings
beneath.”</p>
