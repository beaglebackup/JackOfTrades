<p><strong>CONTROL OF FLOUR BEETLES.</strong> "Pest management professionals may encounter flour beetles more often than any other stored product pest. These beetles feed on almost every processed, grain-based food consumed by people and their pets, and their small size make possible for them to hide in tiny cracks or to enter even the smallest opening in a package.</p>


<p>In homes, all infested food products must be located and either discarded or frozen  six days at O°F (-18°C). A few beetles will normally remain after infested items have been identified and discarded, and these survivors need to be controlled to prevent reinfestation of new food products. All foods should be removed from pantry shelves and shelf paper, if it exists, should be destroyed. The shelves can then be treated with residual insecticide in cracks along the back edges and the ends of shelving and under baseboards in pantries. Food products should not be replaced until the treatment dried. Void areas under the bottom shelves of cabinets may require treatment with residual dust product. Rodenticide place packs in attics are a common source of beetle and should be checked or discarded according to label directions.</p>


<p>Infestations in grocery stores are common under the bottom shelves of the dis  gondolas. These should be vacuumed, cleaned, and then treated with an appropriately residual insecticide. Poor storage and cleaning practices commonly occur in grocery store  and warehouses and contribute to flour beetle infestations. Areas with spilled foods must be cleared and cleaned, and merchandise should be stored off the floor. Any area designated for returned or damaged products should receive close attention. Rodenticide baits should be checked for beetle infestations, and infested bait should be discarded according to label directions.</p>


<p>Food processing facilities and warehouses focus pest management efforts on preven­tion of infestations rather than on elimination after insects are discovered. They also must be ready to eliminate any infestation discovered during inspections. Pheromone traps have been used successfully to monitor for Tribolium flour beetles; however, such monitoring is not nearly as effective as those seen with cigarette beetle and Indian meal moth pheromones. Tribolium pheromone traps combine pheromones with quality food-grade grain oils in several pitfall trap designs. Cone or cylindrical grain probe pitfall traps are used in stored bulk grain to monitor their presence.</p>


<p>Inspection of all incoming material to assure that it is not infested is a common prac­tice for the food industry. Shipments containing beetles are usually rejected. If small amounts of food material in food processing facilities, flour mills, or warehouses are infested, it can be fumigated or destroyed. Some food processing operations require regular, periodic fumigation of the entire building as a preventive strategy against widespread infestations of flour beetles and other pests in the facility. General treatments of cyfluthrin can be effective with thorough coverage in areas of infestations (Arthur 1999b).</p>


Flour beetles can be controlled by extreme heat. Heat treatment is increasingly being used in grain and food processing facilities to control stored product beetles."
