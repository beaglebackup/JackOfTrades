<p><strong>Controlling Moles.</strong>  Options for controlling moles include:<p>

<h4>Physical/Mechanical Control</h4>
Habitat Modification.  "Attempts to resolve mole tunneling problems with applications of turfgrass pest insecticides often fail because moles also prey on earthworms, which may not be affected by insecticides, and because insecticide treatments may not be adequately irrigated to move the insecticides, and because insecticide treatment may not be adequately irrigated to move the insecticide down through the thatch layer and into the root zone where most scarab beetle grubs are found.<p>

Exclusion.  Barrier fences constructed of 1/2-inch-mesh hardware cloth or sheet metal, buried to a depth of 12 to 18 inches and installed around gardens and small planting beds will protect the enclosed areas from surface tunneling but may not prevent moles from entering by way of a deep run.<p>

Live-Trapping.  Pit fall traps can be constructed of large coffee cans or other similar containers buried in planting beds along frequently used surface runs.  Traps must be deep and steep-sided enough to prevent escape once moles fall into them.<p>

Lethal-Trapping.  Two types of kill-traps are commonly available for professional use in controlling moles.  Harpoon (bayonet) traps and scissor-jaw traps (e.g., Out of Sight) both work well for eliminating resident moles from a property, if properly set and maintained.  Both traps are designed to be anchored in the main (frequented) surface runways of moles.  Incorrectly positioned traps will be missed or deliberately avoided by moles as they continue to move through their surface runs.  Traps (three to 12 per property in most cases) should be marked with lawn flags for ease in locating them and helping people on the premises avoid them.  Better yet, traps can be covered with inverted plastic buckets to mark their location and protect people and pets from tampering with traps and possible injury as a result.  If no moles are being capture in traps after several days the trap may need to be removed and repositioned in a surface runway that is clearly active a simple way to find out which surface runs are in use is to flatten all the runs using a lawn roller.  Those which reappear within the nest few days are food runs in which to set traps.  Traps should be checked every two to three days.<p>

Harassment/Intimidation.  A variety of mechanical thumping devices and sonic pulse devices are marketed as being repellent to moles when installed in lawns; however, little scientific or practical evidence exists in support of their efficacy.  Oily liquid repellents (e.g., castor oil) are commercially available for treating runways to repel moles.  The result of such applications is one of temporary avoidance of treated runs by moles.  They move into other areas of the lawn or landscape.<p>

<h4>Chemical Controls</h4>
Toxic Baits.  Until recently, no toxic baits registered for use against moles (e.g., poison peanuts) proved to be effective.  A new anticoagulant mole bait gel product (Kaput Mole Gel Bait) does show promise, however, based on field trials by a number of pests and wildlife control professionals.  This product seems particularly useful for infecting the molehills that lead down steeply to deep runs in the early spring in temperate parts of the U.S.  Such steep runs and the hills that cap them are not conducive to the placement of lethal traps.<p>

One popular home remedy purported to kill moles is to insert rolled-up bits of chewing gum info surface runs.  Supposedly the moles consume the gum and soon die of constipation.  This method has never been proved effective but has likely gained a measure of credibility as a result of the moles coincidentally abandoning an area temporarily when their food supply (insect prey) is inadequate or soil climatic and moisture conditions are not favorable.<p>

Smoke Cartridges and Fumigants.  Smoke cartridges and aluminum phosphide are registered for use in some states for controlling moles; however, these methods are not always reliable because the odor-sensitive moles can quickly wall-off treated tunnels with soil and escape to other runs where the air is breathable.  Furthermore, asphyxicants and fumigants ventilate from dry soils quickly and may not penetrate or persist at a lethal concentration in the runways long enough to kill moles.  Moist soil conditions are best suited to mole tunnel fumigation efforts because fumigants will be retained in the runs for a longer period of time than if performed under dry conditions."<p>
