<p><strong>CONTROLLING RACCOONS, SKUNKS, AND OPOSSUMS.</strong> "Raccoons, skunks, and  opossums are common urban pests that frequently cause problems for homeowners. A variety of control options are available including:</p>

<p><h6>Habitat modification and sanitation.</h6> Food sources attractive to raccoons, skunks, and opossums should be made inaccessible whenever possible. Pet food dishes should be brought indoors at night, and bird feeders are particularly attractive to raccoons. Trash cans, bins and Dumpsters containing food garbage should be secured. Lids of garbage cans should be secured to prevent removal, and the cans should be placed in racks or otherwise anchored to prevent being toppled. Where fruit trees are growing near dwellings, fallen fruit should be cleared away from beneath trees. When raccoons and skunks dig in lawns in search of grubs and other insect prey, attempts to resolve the situation by applying appropriately labeled residual insecticides to control the turfgrass insect pests occasionally remedy the problem, although not immediately.</p>

<p><h6>Harassment/Intimidation.</h6> When a raccoon, skunk or opossum has begun to harbor  beneath a deck, a raised porch or in a crawlspace, the placement of several floodlights  under the deck or floor at the opposite side of the structure from the animal&#39;s entrance has been useful in driving urban wildlife from beneath a building or from the interior of an outbuilding.</p>

<p><h2>Physical/Mechanical Control</h2>
Exclusion. Where feasible, troublesome raccoons, skunks and opossums should be discouraged by exclusion. They are usuallv easv to exclude from dwellings by blocking entrances, although exclusion for some outbuiidings is not always practical. Of particular importance for excluding raccoons is a tightly instaiJed chimney cap.</p>

<p>Ornamental garden pools stocked with fish can sometimes be fitted with removable frames over which wire mesh, nylon, or plastic netting has been stretched. Frames can be  submerged horizontally just below the surface of the water to discourage raccoons from
entering and catching goldfish and other species.</p>


<p>In a few situations, special fences can be useful for protecting backyard vegetable
gardens and family-sized fruit orchards, but ordinary fences will not exclude rac­coons for they are agile climbers. When electrified fences are feasible, wire fences of 1-inch mesh, 36 inches high, work well if a single strand of electric wire charged with a cattle-type fence charger is attached on the outside of the fence about 8 to 9 inches above the ground and about 8 inches outward from the fence. Another type of electrified fence has only three strands of smooth wire spaced 4-1/2, 9, and 13 inches above the ground, making a low raccoon barrier. Generally installed as temporary fences, they are effective in keeping raccoons from corn patches and away from poultry houses. Raccoons, being very sensitive to electric shock, rapidly learn to avoid charged fences.</p>


<p>Metal guards 18 inches or wider wrapped around trees five to six feet above the ground can sometimes be used to deny raccoons access to the roof of a house or other building.</p>

<p>Preventative exclusion for skunks and opossums is accomplished by denying them access to openings in the foundations of homes and voids or easily excavated sites be­ neath buildings. Spaces beneath decks, porches, stairs, and mobile homes should be closed off to exclude these animals. Once a skunk or opossum has made its home beneath a building, the problem is a littJe more difficult. One must be sure the animal has left (or been trapped) before closing off the entrance. That can sometimes be accomplished by sprinkling a smooth layer of tlour or nontoxic tracking powder on the ground at the suspected entrance to form a tracking patch and then examining the area for animal tracks soon after dark. When tracks lead out of the entrance, the opening usually can then be safely closed off.</p>


<p>If the number of invasive skunks or opossums is unknown, the tracking patch can be supplemented by hanging a section of 1/2-inch-mesh hardware cloth over the opening, hinged at the top and left loose on the other three sides. It must be larger than the opening, so that it cannot swing inward. The animals will push it open to leave but ordinarily cannot re-enter. Specially constructed one-way doors that better prevent re-entry are some­ times needed to outsmart a clever animal.</p>


<p>Buried wire fencing can prevent skunks and opossums from excavating or re-entering beneath porches, shallow decks and slab foundations. A skirting or band of 1/2-inch­ mesh hardware cloth must be fastened tightly to the aboveground structure of the porch, deck or foundation. The lower portion of the fence should extend 12 to 18 inches beneath the ground and then 6 inches outward horizontally, below grade. The resulting barrier will discourage skunks and opossums from digging beneath it.</p>




<p><h6>Live-Trapping.</h6> Live-catch wire cage traps (32&quot;x 12&quot;x 10&quot; or similar for raccoons, 24&quot;x 8&quot;x 7&quot; or similar for skunks and opossums) are probably the best method of control for most urban situations. The best traps for skunks are the plastic and metal, the wood and metal, or the sheet-metal enclosed-type box traps that reduce the chances of the trapper being sprayed by the captured animal. A number of live-catch skunk traps are commer­cially available. They should be placed where the animals are entering the building or in active trails.</p>

<p>If the trap containing the skunk is handled with minimum shaking and disturbance, it can be transported without incident.If ordinary wire-cage-type live-catch traps are being used, protection can be afforded by slowly draping a piece of drop cloth, sheet plastic, canvas, or burlap carefully over the trap prior to moving it. This will keep the skunk in the dark and it will be less apt to release its scent. The likelihood ofa trapped skunk spraying while being approached and carried depends on its recent experiences with other animals and humans.</p>

<p>Raccoons, skunks, and opossums may be difficult to lure into a live trap if they have been trapped before and then released, resulting in trap-shy animals. Single door traps are best; however. if the trap is the type with a door on each end. set the trap with only one door open. Traps should be secured to a tree, fencepost, or anchori ng stake to prevent the animal from Lipping it over and stealing the bait without entering the trap. Traps set on lawns (for raccoons and skunks) and roofs (for raccoons) should be secured to a piece of l/4-inch-thick plywood, masonite, or Y2- inch-mesh hardware cloth that is cut at least 12 inches wider and longer than the cage trap used, so as to prevent trapped animals from tearing up sod or shingles around the base of the trap.<p>


<p>Traps should be set to intercept the raccoon, skunk or opossum as it approaches the garden, garbage cans or building (Fig. 17-14). They usually follow established trails, fence lines, buildings, or other cover as they move from the woods. In soft or sandy soil, the trap should be pushed back and forth until the soil tends to cover the wire mesh on the bottom of the trap.<p>

<p>Chunks of corn-on-the-cob make good bait, as do pieces of melon, apple, prunes, sunflower
seeds, peanut butter, and syrup or honey on bread. Also effective in many situations are baits of smoked fish, fish-flavored canned cat food, sardines, frankfurters, cooked fatty meat, fried bacon, raw chicken pans, or mayonnaise. The bait should be placed at the rear or closed end of the trap, but protected so that the animal cannot reach in through the side of the trap and steal the bait. The doors of live traps can first be tied open for several days to permit the animals to become accustomed to the traps and to feeding on the bait (i.e., prebaiting) in situations involving bait-shyness. Once the bait is being accepted, then the traps should be set.</p>


<p>Specially designed live-catch traps are available which can be placed over chimneys to capture raccoons that have taken up residency inside.</p>

<p>Leg-hold traps (e.g., No.2 double-coil spring) are well-suited for capturing raccoons.</p>

<p>In rural areas, several kinds of &quot;sets&quot; are commonly used successfully for raccoons, with the &quot;dirt-hole&quot; set being one of the best. There are several special leg-hold traps designed for raccoons. These are very selective and require the raccoon to put its forepaw into a hole in the trap to obtain the bait, and thus be captured. These are very useful to avoid capturing free-roaming dogs. Leg-hold traps are not recommended for use in urbanized settings.</p>

<p>Control Pole Capture and Trapping by Herding. A raccoon or opossum that has entered the living or workspace of a buiJding must sometimes be captured quickly to prevent personal injury and property damage. This can be achieved using an animal control pole (catch stick) and suitably sized live trap. A single-door cage trap is placed on its closed end with the door facing upward and propped open. Once the raccoon or opossum is secured about the neck or neck and one foreleg (preferred) with the control pole, it can be lifted and &quot;stuffed&quot; into the trap. Once the trap door has been sprung, the noose can be relaxed and the pole withdrawn from the trap. This measure may require two people if the animal is large or difficult to handle. Alternatively, one or more live traps can be set directly along the walls of the room occupied by the animal. The raccoon or opossum usually can be herded or guided in the direction of the nearest trap, especially if the top of the trap is covered with a towel or blanket so that it appears to be a hiding place for the excited animal.<p>

<p>Lethal Trapping. Body-grip traps, although effective and practical for some rural set­ tings, are not suggested for most urban or suburban situations, even where legal.</p>

<p>Shooting. Where safe and legal, spotlighting raccoons, skunks and opossums and shoot­ ing them (e.g., using a .22 caliber rille in rural settings) will eliminate a few animals. In most states, raccoons are considered fur-bearing animals and are hunted during seasons set by law and regulation. Because the protection offered them varies from state to state, consult the local wildlife or conservation agency before any control measures are undertaken.</p>

<p><h2>Chemical Control</h2>
Repellents. One or two pounds of naphthalene crystals (mothballs) can be divided into four to six equal pails and placed into the skunk/opossum-occupied space beneath the porch or building, away from the animal&#39;s entrance. This technique is sometimes effec­ tive in driving animals out and also keeping them out, if replenished occasionally. Ordi­ nary household ammonia, on occasion, has been used as a repellent, contained in shallow open-top pans to permit the vapors to permeate the space beneath the porch or building. However, both of these methods carry the risk of odor penetration into the living and workspaces of the building being treated.</p>

<p>Smoke Cartridges and Fumigants. Occupied skunk dens located away from buildings can be treated using gas cartridges. The same fumigants used for woodchucks are also effective on skunks when used in the same manner. Beneath an occupied building, how­ ever, safety concerns do not permit fumigation.<p>

<p>Dispatching/Euthanasia. Carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide can be used to displace the oxygen in all air-tight chamber (commercially available or custom-built) designed to accommodate one or more live-catch traps. This method asphyxiates the captured animal
while still in the trap and can be used in states that allow or require live-trapped raccoons and skunks to be euthanized. Alternatively, syringe (jab) poles and dispatching fluids (e.g., ketarnine hydrochloride) are commercially available to facilitate dispatching ani­ mals by lethal injection while confined in cage traps. Some states require euthanized wildlife to be disposed of at a sanitary landfill or incineration facility. This process some­ times requires permits from the department of transportation (for transport of hazardous waste) and from the disposal facility. Because of the potential of spreading rabies and distemper, relocating and releasing trapped raccoons and skunks is not advisable and is illegal in some slates."</p>
