<h1>Webbing
Clothes Moth</h1>
<h2>Tineola
bisselliella (Humel)</h2>

<p>
“The webbing clothes moth is
worldwide in distribution.  Some individuals are of the opinion that
Europe is its original home, but Austen et al. (1935) stated that in
all probability it is native to Africa.  This species is undoubtedly
the most common fabric moth in the United States, since it is the one
most often referred to in papers on moth damage.  The webbing clothes
moth is considered a serious pest of museum objects (Pinniger 2001)
and historic churches (Mueller 1996).  It is also cited as a pest
that can cause sever economic loss in drapery shops and rug stores
(Plarre et al. 1999).</p>

<p><strong>Adult.</strong>
 The webbing clothes moth adult has a body covered with shiny golden
scales, and the top of the head bears a fluffy pompadour of reddish
golden hairs.  The compound eyes are black and the antennae are
darker than the rest of the body.  The wings are without spots and
have an expanse of approximately ½ inch (12 mm).  When resting, the
length of the folded wings is from ¼ to 1/3 inch (6 to 8 mm), the
larger size being that of the female.  Adult clothes moths are
characterized by narrow wings, folded over the body at rest and
fringed with long hairs.  This moth can easily be confused with the
Angoumois grain moth, a pest of cereals that may be found flying
during the day.  The hind-wings of the Angoumois grain moth end in a
thin pointed tip while those of the clothes moth are rounded.</p>

<p>The
hind-wing margins are fringed with long hairs, which increase their
effective surface area, according to Busvine (1980).  Adults have
three methods of movement: flying, running, and jumping.  The clothes
moths that do fly are ordinarily males, since the females, usually
heavy with eggs, prefer to walk or run.  However, the female may be
found on the wing after she has laid her eggs, and, at times, may fly
even when she is gravid.  When this moth does fly, it usually stays
in the darker areas of the room and ordinarily does not flit around
lamps, as do the outdoor species of moths.  Herrick (1933) found the
adults to be capable of flying fairly long distances.  Thus, houses
150 to 300 feet (45 to 91 m) from a warehouse containing infested raw
wool were soon infested.  According to Griswold (1931, 1933), the
sexes are about evenly distributed in number.  Studies by Titshak
(1936) showed that when food is scarce, males predominate, but when
food is abundant, females are most common.  The moth, upon emerging,
leaves its pupal skin partly protruding from the cocoon.</p>

<p>During
copulation, the moths rest with their bodies in opposite directions,
according to Griswold (1944).  Austin et al. (1935) observed the
average life of the adult to be 28.3 days for the male and 16 days
for the female at a temperature of 68*F to 77*F(29*C to 25*C). 
During the winter at a lower temperature, the time is extended to 34
days. Whitfield and Cole (1958) completed detailed studies eon the
biology of this moth.</p>

<p>Michaelbacher
and Furman (1951) found that when disturbed, the moths run rapidly or
fly to hide in folds and other secluded places.</p>

<p><strong>Egg.</strong>
 The egg is large, oval, ivory white, about 1/24 inch (1 mm) long,
and barely visible against black background.  Griswold (1944) noted
that under the binocular microscope it has many narrow ridges. 
According to Austen et al. (1935), the eggs are laid singly or in
groups of two or more.  Although the eggs are fragile, they actually
are harder than carpet beetle eggs and can be shaken in a sieve
without harming them.</p>

<p>The
average number of eggs laid by a female is between 40 to 50; however,
this number may range from 30 to 160.  Austen et al. (1935) found one
female deposited 221 eggs. The length of the egg-laying period and
the number of eggs laid varies with ambient temperature.  Oviposition
usually begins a day after mating and can last for several weeks,
although most eggs are laid in the first two weeks (Plarre et al.
1999).  Benedict (1917) noted that the eggs are placed amount the
threads and fastened by some gelatinous material so that they do not
readily shake off.  The female dies after laying all her eggs.  The
males often liver several weeks longer, during which time they
continue to mate.</p>

<p>The
time necessary for the hatching of eggs varies according to
environmental conditions.  Various authors found that eggs hatch in
from two days to three weeks, with an average of four to 10 days
during the summer; the longer period occurring during the winter.  In
artificially heated buildings, the moths will emerge, and the larvae
will feed throughout the cold season.  This insect reportedly does
not over winter in the egg stage, since the embryo is unable to
survive long periods of incubation.  Parker (1900a) does not believe
long-dormant eggs can hatch.  Sand-like particles associated with an
infestation as not eggs.  They are the excrement that falls on or
below the feeding sites and can be found stuck to silk webbing
scattered below the infested area.</p>

<p>Brokerhof
et al. (1992) found that the egg stage of the webbing clothes moth
was most tolerant of cold.  Chauvin and Vannier (1997) showed that to
destroy eggs instantaneously, they must be exposed to -29*C.  This is
the temperature at which ice crystals form within the egg and it is
destroyed immediately, also known as the Super Cooling Point (SCP). 
Higher temperatures, over longer periods of time, will also kill
eggs.  
</p>

<p><strong>Larva.</strong>
 Upon emerging from the egg, the larva is active, white, translucent,
and about 1/24 inch (1 mm) long.  The average weight of the newly
emerged larva is 0.0273 mg, and the average full-grown larvae is 3.08
mg.  The healthy young larva is shiny and greasy appearing and, like
most Lepidoptera larvae, has three pairs of jointed legs and four
pairs of prolegs on the abdominal segments.  The last segment has a
pair of appendages, the claspers.  Busvine (1980) reported that the
larvae have short antennae, but no simple eyes (ocelli).  They are
able to distinguish the general direction of a source of light, and
they crawl away from it.  Coleman (1940a) noted that in museum
storage situations, it is not uncommon to find active infestations
inside acid-free boxes, Hollinger boxes, textile storage boxes, and
cabinetry.  The merging larvae commence to feed almost immediately
where suitable food is available.  The size of the full-grown larva
is dependent on a number of conditions (e.g., food, temperature,
moisture, etc.) in any event, it ordinarily does not attain a size
greater than ½ inch (12 mm).  With regard to the effect of food on
larval growth.  Austen et al. (1935) noted that starving with larvae
results in a reduction in size.  When those larvae become adults,
they are not capable of depositing fertile eggs.  The measure of
control based upon larval starvation would not, however, be
significant.  Larvae, especially the older ones, may live without
food for sometime.</p>

<p>Busvine
(1980) described how the larva feeds; it typically bites off a fiber,
chews on the stump and moves on to the nest fiber.  The result is a
trail of damaged hairs.  More hairs are damaged than consumed. 
Benedict (1917) conducted some interesting experiments utilizing the
fact that ingested foods are seen though the transparent body.  He
fed the larvae on felts of diverse colors and obtained larvae with
median streaks of red, blue, green, etc.  Since the dyes of the
various materials are unaffected by the digestive processes, the
excreta commonly observed at the feeding site had taken on the color
of the larval food.  Starved larvae expel no feces for two days after
being fed.  The slow rate of digestion is probably due to the
difficulty of coping with keratin, which is sometimes excreted
partially undigested.</p>

<p>The
larva may spin a feeding tunnel of silk and may incorporate some of
the fibers on which it is feeding, as well as its fecal particles. 
The webbing clothes moth larva does not construct a portable silken
case.  Benedict (1917) found the larva may feed for some distance in
this tube, and in certain instances, it will abandon the tube, build
another, and commence to feed once again.  Some of the larvae merely
spin a small silken patch here and there and graze as they go along.</p>

<p>The
amount of silk spun by 500 larvae in a week was found to average 0.1
mg each, which was 1.7% of the mean body weight.  The larva is more
or less stationary in its silken tunnel, and concentrates on feeding
in this one area.  Feeding tubes occur commonly in dark, secretive
areas of clothes such as under collars and cuffs, or as described
earlier, underneath furniture.  The larvae often are very active and
may be found crawling on clothes or on the floor beneath badly
infested upholstered furniture.  Curran (1949) stated that if the
larva finds the food satisfactory, it may finish development within 1
inch (24 mm) of where the egg was deposited.  Otherwise, it moves on.
 When the larva feeds between the carpet and the floor, it may extend
its tubes along and inside the floor cracks.  Webbing beneath the
carpet indicates the presence of the larva.</p>

<p>According
to Back (1935), many of the larvae that hatch during the summer do
not become moths until the following spring.  At times, the larva may
enter resting stage without apparent cause.  It becomes inactive,
ceases feeding and growing, and only later especially if disturbed,
continues its normal activities.  These larval dormant periods may
extend from eight to no more than 24 months, and its is believed
that, in nature, the cessation of activity allows it to survive
unfavorable periods.  Moving these dormant forms can initiate new
infestations.  Apparently, the number of molts varies greatly,
depending especially upon the duration of the larval period.  Smith
and Whitman (1992) stated that the larvae may molt from five to 45
time.  Back (1935) observed that the shortest record for the
completion of the larval stage was 40 days at 85*F (29.5*C). 
Griswold (1944) observed that males require about 30 days and the
females 35 days for the duration of the larval stage.</p>

<p>The
great variation in the time to complete the larval development
appears to be dependent in part on food, temperature, and humidity
and may be very short or up to 29 months.</p>

<p><strong>Pupa.</strong>
 The larva, having reached full development, spins a pupal case of
silk, which is smooth on the inside; but on the outside may have bits
of the dyed textile on which it is feeding, as well as fecal
particles, incorporated.  The size of the case varies from 1/6 to ¼
inch (4 to 6 mm) in length.  The investigators differ greatly on the
time necessary for pupation, probably because their observations were
made under varied environmental conditions.  Various researchers
found the pupal stage lasted from eight to 44 days depending on the
season.  None mentioned the humidity factor.  The Super Cooling Point
of the webbing clothes moth pupa was found to be the same as the
larva; -25*C by Chauvin and Vannier (1997).</p>

<p><strong>Life History.</strong>  Adult
webbing clothes moths may be found in an artificially warmed building
at any time of the year.  During the summer, the adults are on the
wing from May through July.  Nagel (1920) stated that in Germany, two
chief flight periods occur, in the spring and autumn, but overlapping
broods occur due to the prolonged life of some of the larvae.  
</p>

<p>Nagel
(1920) also found that it took five to nine months to go from the egg
stage through larva, pupa, adult and back to egg.  Back (1935)
recorded a developmental period in an incubator from the day the egg
was laid to emergence from the pupal stage of 55 days at a
temperature of 84*F (29*C).  He concluded that the variation in the
length of the life history may be from 55 days to four years but
under optimum conditions averages 65 to 90 days.  Griswold (1944)
recorded a developmental period from egg to adult of 35 days for five
webbing clothes moths.  Notini (1939), in Sweden, found this insect
may produce four generations a year in the warmed parts of buildings
but only one generation in unheated areas.  Griswold and Crowell
(1936) noted that the most favorable humidity was 75% , and lower
relative humidities increased the time required for development. 
They were of the opinion that the dry atmosphere of spring and summer
may hasten development.”
