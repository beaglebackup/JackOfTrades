<h2>MANAGEMENT OF BEE AND WASP INFESTATIONS</h2>



<p>"The first step in managing bee and wasp infestations should be a thorough inspection of the area(s) affected including both the structure and surrounding property. Interviews with property owners/tenants will usually quickly pinpoint areas of activity. Specimens may need to be collected for proper identification and determination of control options and procedures. The preventive and corrective measures most appropriate to the situation must be considered. What equipment and materials are necessary to perform the service effectively and professionally? What cooperative efforts must be enlisted from the customer? Ax what hours of the day or night will the service pose the least risk to the customer, to children and adult onlookers, to pets and non-target wildlife/beneficial organisms?</p>


<h2>TREATMENT OF GROUND NESTS</h2>

<p><strong>DIGGER WASPS, CICADA KILLERS, YELLOWJACKETS, BUMBLE BEES, ETC.</strong> The burrows of both social and solitary bees and wasps can be treated liberally with an appropriately labeled insecticide dust (Fig. 12-22). The burrows of solitary wasps can be closed with ample soil to prevent re-excavation except for those of cicada killer wasps which should remain open. All the occupants of the nest will be contained in the treatment zone, and the developing immatures and newly emerged adults will also be killed. Following daytime treatment, the ground nests of social wasps and bees should be left open so that returning workers will enter the nest to contact the insecticide. During the day, returning foragers temporarily will be wary of entering treated burrows and will fly around the entrances in a state of agitation for some time. At this point, persons and pets that wander too close may be attacked. Additional injections of insecticide dust may be required should any new burrows be created. The nest entrance can be sealed with soil following any night treatment.</p>



<h2>TREATMENT OF EXPOSED NESTS</h2>

<p><strong>MAUD DAUBERS.</strong> Homeowners do not care for the unsightly mud nests constructed by mud daubers on the walls and in garages of their homes. Mud nests with holes in them mean the wasps have either completed their life cycle and have left or a bird has raided ne nests for their tasty contents. Control efforts are not often necessary si nee mud daubers rarely sting and are beneficial by preying on spiders and insects. Mud nests can be removed from masonry and siding using a scraper tool on a long or telescoping handle in conjunction with a vacuum cleaner. The attachment sites can be pressure washed and treated with a residual wettable powder or microencapsulated insecticide to prevent wasps from rebuilding in those locations.</p>



<p><strong>PAPER WASPS.</strong> Most paper wasps are not particularly aggressive; however, their pref­erence for constructing nests in the corners of windows, above doorways, behind shut­ters, under decks, and inside electric boxes and grills bring them into close contact with people. Nests are easily destroyed by treatment with a quick knockdown insecticide in a long-range aerosol type product or a wettable powder. Paper wasps also can be easily removed from their nests by spraying them with soapy water which renders them incapable of flight and causes them to &quot;drown.&quot; The nests should be removed after treatment of the wasps, and the nest site treated using an appropriately labeled residual insecticide to prevent other wasps from building nests on that site. Plastic barrier tape can be used 1 cordon off areas where nests associated with playground equipment or landscaping are being treated while children are around. Nests within voids should be treated using residual dust product.</p>



<p><strong>AERIAL YELLOWJACKETS.</strong> The paper nests of the bald-faced hornet and the yello­w hornet are best treated at night when foragers are inside. Nests treated during the day only kill some of the workers and returning workers often begin reconstructing a new nest; the site where the old one was removed. Red or amber-filtered light can be used to illuminate and target nests without alerting and attracting the guard wasps at the nest&#39;s entrance.</p>

<p>
Application of an appropriately labeled dust insecticide can be made directly into the nest entrance; however, poking the duster&#39;s tip through the back side of the paper nest might be a safer strategy for pest management professionals. An­ other strategy that works well for accessible nests is to pull a large, heavy plastic bag up over the nest and then cut the branches holding the nest. A non-residual aerosol or a residual dust insecticide can then be injected into the bag and the bag sealed. Nests should be removed from walls or cut out of trees or shrubs following treatment. Inactive nests make excellent display items, but they should be thoroughly dried prior to displaying. Treatment of the nest&#39;s exterior with a clear spray lacquer helps preserve the paper covering of the nest.</p>

<h2>TREATMENT OF NESTS IN STRUCTURAL VOIDS</h2>



<p><strong>PAPER WASPS, YELLOWJACKETS, AND BUMBLE BEES.</strong> Species which nest in eaves behind the fascia board, ceiling voids, soffits, wall voids, hollow cement block, and excavated galleries in wood and other concealed spaces can be treated by injecting such places with an appropriately labeled dust insecticide. When dealing with paper wasps nesting in such voids, the insecticide should be applied into the main entry holes and gaps used by the wasps to enter.</p>

<p>
Because the nests of yellowjackets, hornets, and bumble bees may be located several feet from entry points, an effort should be made to locate the voids where the colony is located using a listening device. Remember, some nests might extend into several wall voids or into ceiling voids. Once located, a small hole can be drilled directly into the nest from inside the structure and the void treated with a residual dust insecticide. If inside drilling is not possible, drilling into the void(s) and treatment can be completed from outside. The nest entrance holes should not be sealed until death of the colony is con­ firmed.</p>

<p>
In a few cases, yellowjackets have constructed large nests in exterior walls with one side exposed inside a garage, a shed, an attic, or a basement. The gray paper of the nest resembles that of the aerial yellowjackets, and the nest is easily treated by poking a duster through the paper to inject a residual dust insecticide.</p>

<p>
Occasionally, yellowjackets Living in wall voids run out of space, and the wasps chew their way through the drywall and enter the structure&#39;s living space. The presence of large numbers of wasps flying about the windows can be quite alarming to homeowners, and they should be instructed to seal off the room until the pest management professional can arrive.  Once in the room, the break-through hole in the wallboard or ceiling should be located and temporarily sealed with copper gauze or steel wool.  The wasps in the room can be quickly removed using a vacuum device, and the colony treated as described above.</p>



<h2>SPECIAL WASP AND BEE SITUATIONS</h2>

<p><strong>FIREPLACES.</strong> Occasionally, several yellowjackets or honey bees will be found daily in a particular room or area of a house. A superficial inspection of the exterior structure may reveal no yellowjacket or honey bee activity. Upon closer inspection, however, these insects are commonly found entering and exiting from a chimney flue. Most of the in­sects entering the living area below, slipped down the flue and exited through the fire­ place. The worker wasps may be observed moving to and from a missing mortar joint between flue tiles inside the chimney, usually within several feet of the top. The nest will usually be constructed inside the void within the outer chimney casing, around the flue(s). A generous injection of an appropriately labeled insecticide dust will usually be suffi­cient. The mortar joint should be patched after death of the nest has been confirmed. In the meantime, the wasps or bees can be blocked from entering the living space by sealing over the fireplace temporarily with tape and plastic sheeting.</p>

<p>
Sometimes, during swarming season, honey bees can be observed entering a house through the chimney flue when no swarm or nest can be found. In such cases, it can be assumed that scout bees are looking for a suitable cavity for the swarm to inhabit but are unable to find an exit once inside.</p>

<p><strong>BASEMENTS AND CRAWLSPACES.</strong> Great numbers of yellowjackets may make their way into a basement or crawlspace if a nest has been built in one of the following sites:</p> 
<p>1.) Inside the hollow cement block of the foundation wall. In this case workers and recently enclosed reproductives may enter through uncapped block from below the sill and may be seen as they are attracted to nearby basement windows and electric lights.</p>

<p>
2.) Within the cantilevered joist structure supporting bay windows and offset walls (found in split level homes). Enough gaps may exist alongside the tufts of fiberglass insula­tion filling the deep, box sills to allow the yellowjackets to detect light and crawl through to the crawlspace and basement areas.</p>

<p>
3.) In an outside wall void where enough space exists between structural compo­nents to allow the yellowjackets to move downward inside the wall and through joints in the subflooring along the sill plate or through pipe cuts in the plate or subflooring.</p>

<p>
Each of these situations should be approached with the goal of treating the nest, then either removing it or using exclusion materials to close off the gaps being used by the insects to enter the living spaces. If finding the entry point(s) is difficult, a bright drop Light or insect light trap can be placed as close to the source as possible while other light sources are minimized. The wasps will be attracted to the brightest light source and can be generally confined to that area until the situation can be resolved.</p>



<p><strong>FALL AND SPRING APPEARANCES.</strong> Mated female yellowjackets and paper wasps frequently overwinter inside structural voids for many of the same reasons they nest in those situations - the layered effect of structural components offers security against most predators and protection from exposure to the elements. These insects begin to seek out over­ wintering sites in September and leave those sites permanently during April or May in the temperate regions of North America. Unfortunately for the human occupants of these structures, overwintering wasps: (1) mobilize every time the temperature reaches their activity threshold, which occurs during sunny, abnormally warm fall and winter days; and (2) move in the direction of warmth and Light, of­ ten heading indoors instead of outdoors.</p>

<p>
An untreated or insufficiently treated yellowjacket nest in a structural void of a building will continue to give rise to newly emerged workers, females, and males late into fall (in temperate regions) because radiant warmth from inside exceeds the threshold temperature for development of pupae. These unwelcome appearances will continue as long as viable pupae exist to give rise to new adults, which can then find their way into the living spaces. Potential entry points should be investigated and sealed using appropriate exclusion mate­rials as part of a long-term preventive program.</p>

<p>
Overwintering paper wasp queens can ac­ cumulate in large numbers in the walls, attics, false ceilings, and chimneys of both homes and commercial buildings. Often, these wasps only appear at the top floors of a tall building where they have been carried by thermal updrafts next to the building. Reed and Landolt (1991) reported on paper wasp activity around tall structures in Florida, including the NASA shuttle pad at the Kennedy Space Center.</p>

<p>
Paper wasps crawl into cracks around windows and make their way into walls and false ceilings. The best solution to this situation is to treat the exte­rior cracks, but these are often not accessible. Drilling and treatment of the voids around windows in affected rooms can be helpful; however, such efforts usually provide only temporary relief. Insect light traps placed above false ceilings can attract and capture most wasps before they can enter the living spaces below. Long-term relief is achieved by sealing cracks and holes in the exterior walls during the summer months.</p>

</ul></p>

<p><strong>EXTERIOR ACTIVITY.</strong> It was once believed the best time to control a wasp population was to trap or kill the queens in the spring as they are flying about foraging for food. Richards (1961) mentions a campaign in Berkshire in 1901 where school children were paid to collect queen wasps, but the effort was unsuccessful. He also cites in 1950 where the Cyprus Department of Agriculture killed 243,394 queens, and that many queens also were killed by the public, and yet 1950 was one of the worst wasp years recorded. Spradbery (1973) notes even if 99.9% of potential queens were eliminated, the same number of annual colonies would be maintained.</p>

<p>
It appears many queens coming out of hibernation are unsuccessful in establishing colonies. Richards (196L) cites Beirne as showing that the weather in the spring is the important factor in colony establishment. David (1978) cites Akre (1976) as reaching the same conclusion regarding yellowjacket populations in the Pullman area of southeastern Washington.</p>



<p><strong>OUTSIDE EVENTS.</strong> Yellowjackets are often the scourge of fairs, picnics, patio dining areas, and the like as they forage on sweet beverages, fruits, and meaty foods, and investigate wearers of perfume and cologne. The most effective measures for keeping yellowjacket intrusion to a minimum are:</p>

<p>
1.) Keep all food and beverages in covered containers.</p>

<p>2.) Frequently clean the outside surfaces of beverage and food serving equipment.</p> 
<p>3.) Clean up spills as they occur, whenever possible.</p>
<p>4.) Use covered waste containers; thoroughly wash waste containers daily; replace plas­tic liner bags at least daily or as they become full.</p>
<p>5.) Treat inside surfaces of trash containers with an effective yellowjacket repellent, where permissible.</p>
<p>6.) Keep trash containers away home serving and eating areas.</p>
<p>7.) Avoid wearing fragrant personal grooming products to outdoor events if they have caused bad experiences in the past.</p>
<p>8.) Install strong fans to blow across areas to keep yellowjackets away.</p>

<p>
Many studies have been conducted to attract and control yellowjackets over relatively wide areas using insecticide baits (Keh 1968; Perrott 1975; Wagner and Reierson 1969, 1971). To date, baits have yielded poor results in the eastern U.S. and only limited suc­cess in western states because (1) yellowjackets are very selective in their food preferences, rejecting most prepared baits, and (2) where foraging activity is heavy, even an effective bait will do little to diminish the investigation of all available food sources (MacDonald 1993; Reid et al. 1995).</p>

<p>
Food and pheromone lure traps are sometimes used to control foraging yellowjackets at outside events. Gulmahamad (2002) used traps in a season-long attempt to control yellowjackets at a California amusement park. Most of the wasps foraging on the prop­erty originated from nests outside its boundaries, thus preventing direct control of the nests. The 80+ traps placed around the park trapped thousands of wasps yet seemed to have little impact on the numbers of wasps seen inside the park. He concluded that traps alone could not provide the level of control expected by the customer.</p>



<p><strong>DUMPSTERS.</strong> Dumpsters with tight-fitting, hinged covers should be used at businesses where the refuse consists of food and sweet beverage products. The Lids should be kept secured between loads. Dumpsters need to be kept at least 50 feet away from the nearest service entrance to the building. During peak activity months of yellowjackets, they should be emptied daily and then spray-washed with the appropriate cleaning materials. Spills on pavement around Dumpsters should be cleaned regularly and is best done at night when wasps are not active.</p>



<p><strong>TREES AND SHRUBS.</strong> A number of trees and shrubs, including maples, willows, arbor­ vitae evergreens, euonymus, and quince become infested with aphids, scale insects, and other sap-feeding insects of the order Homoptera. These insects excrete small droplets of a sugary liquid called &quot;honeydew,&quot; which attracts yellowjackets, paper wasps, honey bees, and ants in great numbers (Wegner 1993). The resulting activity misleads onlookers to believe that wasps and bees are nesting in those trees and shrubs. A careful inspection will reveal the true nature of the problem and a foliage treatment with an insecticide approved for both the host plant and homopterous insects should quickly abate the foraging activity of the bees and wasps. In most states, a turf and ornamental license will be required for such treatments.</p>



<p><strong>PREVENTIVE PROGRAM FOR STRUCTURES.</strong> Stinging insects use human structures to nest on because of their solidity and protective cover features. They readily nest and overwinter in structural voids because they can locate numerous structural gaps, 114-inch or larger, that lead to hundreds of comfortable, secure cavities. Also, easily excavated materials such as cedar, plasterboard, Styrofoam:&quot; and spun fiberglass are components of most structures. The best way to keep wasps from nesting on or entering structures is to anticipate the most likely areas favored by these insects and treat them using an approved residual insecticide, taking care to avoid streaking windows or staining dark woodwork and siding. Obvious gaps leading to voids can be injected with an approved insecticide dust. Exclusion/pest-proofing materials can be used to repair likely entry points.</p>
