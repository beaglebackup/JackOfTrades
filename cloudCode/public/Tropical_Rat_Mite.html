<h1>Tropical Rat Mite </h1>
<h2>(Ornithonyssus
bacoti)</h2>

<p><strong>Background Information.</strong> There
are over 45,000 species of mites. Mites are closely related to
spiders and ticks. 
</p>

<p><strong>Distribution &amp; Habitat.</strong> Because
of their association with Norway rats and other rodents, tropical rat
mites can be found worldwide. Although, as the name suggests, they do
prefer warmer climates. Tropical rat mites live in and around the
rodent nests and prefer to be near heat sources like hot water pipes
or stoves. If the host animal dies or the population of mites becomes
too large for the nest they will move to these warm areas and travel
to find other blood meals. 
</p>

<p><strong>Identification.</strong> Tropical rat mites
are very small, 1-1.5mm in length, usually compared to a period at
the end of sentence. Because of their small size, they are typically
identified by the presence of a host animal. Tropical rat mites are
associated with rodents like Norway rats, roof rats and the house
mouse. 
</p>

<p><strong>Life Cycle.</strong> Within
three days of becoming an adult, a the mite will feed and mate. The
female lays eggs about two days after mating and hatch in about a day
and a half. Females can lay up to 100 eggs in her lifetime. The
larvae need a blood meal from the host before they can molt into the
second nymphal stage. They can then molt from the second nymphal
stage to adult when it is between 68° to 72°F. The entire
development takes about 11-12 days and requires at least 4 blood
meals. 
</p>

<p><strong>Feeding
&amp; Behavior.</strong> Tropical
rat mites have been found to survive up to 63 days without a blood
meal. 
</p>

<p><strong>Health Concerns.</strong> On
humans, bites can be found anywhere, but typically occur in warm and
constricted area like around clothing waistbands, armpits and under
the breasts. Tropical rat mites can cause painful, itchy bites and
dermatitis. They are not known to transfer any diseased to humans,
but secondary skin infections can occur from scratching.
