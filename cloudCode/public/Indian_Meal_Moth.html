<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“<font face="Avenir Book, serif">Indian
meal moths are general feeders upon grain and grain products, dried
fruits, seeds, graham crackers, nuts, powered milk, chocolate,
candies, etc.  In homes, dried red peppers, bird seed, and dehydrated
dog food containing meat and cereal are commonly infested.  This pest
is especially important and very destructive wherever dried fruits
are stored.  It is a native of the Old World and presently
cosmopolitan in distribution.  A few larvae in a package with their
webbing and frass are very repulsive to homeowners, and costly to the
firm marketing the material.  Figs in particular are readily
infested.  </font>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Although
it is selfdom as pest of milling machinery, like the Mediterranean
flour moth, its webbing will in time become sufficiently abundant in
previously injured grain to become noticeable.  Since it prefers the
coarser grades of flour, it is the most common insect in packages of
whole wheat, graham flour, and corn meal.  The larva webs together
the flour with strands of silk, forming clumps.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">The
Indian meal moth is the most common food-infesting moth found in
homes, grocery stores, and any place where dried pet foods are
produced or stored.  Cox and Bell (1991) noted that this moth “has
the widest distribution of all moths generally infested stored foods
and is truly a global pest.”  Home infestations can be traced back
to nearly any food source but commonly originate in dried pet food or
bird seed.  Nuts are also a common breeding source, especially the
nut caches of squirrels in attics and chimneys.  Dried flour
arrangements containing seed-bearing stalks are also susceptible. 
Indian meal moths can also enter homes from outdoor sources such as
seeds or nuts found on the ground, rodent and squirrel nests or from
seed in bird feeders.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font color="#1f497d"><font face="Avenir Book, serif"><b>DESCRIPTION.</b></font></font><font face="Avenir Book, serif">
 Indian meal moths are the easiest food-infesting moth to identify. 
The wing span is about 5/8 inch (16 mm) and the outer half to
one-third of the front wing is covered with reddish-copper scales. 
These scales, however, are often rubbed off and are indistinct in
older specimens.  Under magnification, any remaining reddish-copper
colored scales can be seen on the wings.  </font>

<font color="#1f497d"><font face="Avenir Book, serif"><b>LIFE
HISTORY.</b></font></font><font face="Avenir Book, serif">  This
species commences the year with a brood of overwintering larvae that
pupate mostly in March and emerge in April.  The generations overlap
as the seasons progress.  The female begins oviposition at night
about three days after emerging.  The eggs are grayish-white and 0.3
to 0.5 mm in length.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Upon
hatching, the larvae disperse.  Within a few hours, they establish
themselves on the crevices of fruit or enter packaging through
cracks.  The larva is 3/8 to ¾ inch (9 to 19 mm) in length, with an
average of about 5/8 inch (13 mm).  Its color is usually dirty white,
but may range from pink to brown to a greenish tinge.  The larvae
feed in or near a tunnel-like case of frass and silk they web
together.  They then emerge from their food source and can travel
some distance before spinning their cocoons in crevices or at
wall/ceiling junctions.  Pupation usually occurs in the vicinity of
their food.  The sex ratio is, on average, 1:1, but the emergence of
males and females of a particular generation can be displaced by food
shortage, the females tending to emerge later.”</font></p>
