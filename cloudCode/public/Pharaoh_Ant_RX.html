<p><strong>IMPORTANT POINTS.</strong>  Research has revealed several important points about Pharaoh ant control:<p>
<ul>
<li>1.	Baits are the only effective method for control or elimination of Pharaoh ants.</li><br>
<li>2.	Residual treatments generally should not be used in Pharaoh ant control (Vail 1997) because they result in colony budding (formation of new nests), contaminate bait stations, and kill only foraging ants.  However, treat or r emoving a single nest in a potted plant is a viable control option if the nest is accessible enough to allow for compete colony treatment (D. H. Oi, USDA-ARS, Gainesville, FLa., personal communication).</li><br>
<li>3.	Bait-switching in Pharaoh ants (Edwards and Abraham !990) demands that professionals monitor populations for changes in food preference.</li><br> 
<li>4.	IGRs (e.g., Pharorid, which contains methoprene) allow for more intercolony transfer of baits than metabolic inhibitors, which are more localized in their effect (Oi et al. 2000).</li><br>
<li>5.	For structural infestations where Pharaoh ants are foraging both inside and outside, an outdoor application of bait is sufficient to grain control (OI et al. 1994).</li><p>
</ul>

To be effective, baits must be applied systematically.  For proper placement, trails and resources (both food and water) must be located.  In an apartment complex infested with Pharaoh ants, for example, the professional should first interview each occupant.  This is a good way to determine where ants are active, and it gives the professional a chance to educate the client about the bait control program.  It is important for the client to understand that delayed-action baits will take time to eliminate the ants.<p>
