<h1>Black/Varied Carpet Beetle</h1>
<h1>Black Carpet Beetle</h1>
<h2>Attagenus unicolor (Brahm) = A. megatoma (F,)</h2>


<p>

“Carpet beetles are primarily pests of fabric, fur, or feathers, nests of birds and mammals, and keratin containing articles.  Larvae are omnivorous and have been found infesting plant materials, dog food, milk powder, crackers, cookies, dried pepper, fishmeal, and dried meats.  They are often found in feed mills and warehouse s with poor sanitation.  Adult beetles are 1/8 to 3/16 inch (3 to 5 mm) long and a uniform black to brown in color with short brown hairs.  Larva are slender, ¼ to ½ inch (5 to 13 mm) long, and golden brown to dark brown in color with short hairs and a “tail of longer hairs”.  Adults feed on pollen and do not create other damage. Only one generation of adults emerges per year, beginning in early April.”

<h1>Varied Carpet Beetle</h1>
<h2>Anthrenus verbasci (Linnaeus)</h2>

<p>“This is a common insect that mainly infests feathers, furs, and fabrics and is often associated with bird nests.  Larvae can be found infesting processed foods such as corn meal, dried corn meal, dried red pepper, fishmeal, cacao and cereals.  Adult beetles are 1/16 to 1/8 inch (2 to 3 mm) long with a varied pattern of elongated white, yellow, and brownish scales.  The underside is covered with mostly gray scales.  Larvae are 1/16 to 1/5 inch (2 to 5 mm) long and tan to brown in color, with prominent tufts of hairs on the posterior end.  Adults feed on pollen and do not cause any damage.  One generation of adults occurs per year although the life cycle may last two years, depending on temperature.  Adult emergence generally occurs beginning early in March.”<p>
