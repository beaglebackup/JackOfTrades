<h1>Field Crickets</h1>
<h2>Gryllus spp.</h2>


<p>

“The genus Gryllus has 16 descibed species with others yet to be named (Arnett 2000) as is distributed widely throughout North America, Central America, and the northern part of South America.  The field crickets are usually black in color, ½ to 1.25 inches (13 to 33 mm) long, and more robust than the house cricket.  The rear wings are projected back beyond the front wings like pointed tails.  Many of the species can only be separated on the basis of their song.  Mickle and Walker (1974) provided a useful key to field crickets of the Southeast.<p>
Field crickets are the most common cricket found in pastures and meadows where they are injurious to many field crops, especially alfalfa, wheat, and oats.  In the Gulf Coast states, they sometimes damage tomatoes, peas, beans, or strawberries.  They also feed on weakened crickets and other insects.  They may attack textiles of cotton, linen, wool, and silk, as well as furs.  Clothing that is stained with perspiration or food is more prone to injury.  Articles made from nylon, wood, plastic fabrics, thin rubber goods, and leather also may be damaged.<p>
Huge populations occur annually in some areas, plaguing many buildings as the adult crickets are strongly attracted to exterior lighting.  Literally thousands of crickets may be found burrowing into any available crack or harborage, may entering through poorly sealed doorways and other openings.  The author has observed crickets in Dallas one summer flying up to the top of tall buildings, even as high as 30 stories where they served as food for numerous black widow spiders harboring on the roof.  Thus, infestation in commercial buildings may originate from the roof as well as the foundation.<p>
Mackie (1938) noted that in California the conenose bug, Rasahus thoracius Stal., is predacious on Gryllidae, and in the vicinity of homes, a number of cases of Conenose bites to humans were reported.  Calasoma beetles and the American cockroach also have been observed feeding on dead and injured crickets.<p>
<p><strong>LIFE HISTORY.</strong>  Field crickets typically produce one generation each year, but in the southern areas, three generations per year may occur.  Ninety-five percent of these insects overwinter in the egg stage, 5% as nymphs in the fifth and sixth instars.  Crickets that overwinter in the egg stage usually hatch in May, though temperature and rainfall affect the time of hatching.  They become adults in July and August, mate, and usually died in September, although some may live until the first frost.<p>
Two weeks after becoming an adult,  the female may intermittently lay eggs for two months or longer, until death ensues.  The eggs are deposited in the soil at depths of from ¼ to 1 inch (6 to 25 mm).  Fifty or more eggs may be laid in an areas covering not more than 2 square inches.  The eggs are laid singly with no protective secretion.  The total number of eggs per female laid ranges from 150 to 400.  The newly emerged nymph can walk, run, and jump immediately after hatching and passes through eight to 10 instars before molting into an adult.  The females usually have nine instars and the males eight; therefore, females become adults later than the males.  The crickets mature in 78 to 90 days although the range may be from 65 to 102 days.”<p>
