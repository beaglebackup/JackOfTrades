<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“<font face="Avenir Book, serif">The
genus Gryllus has 16 descibed species with others yet to be named
(Arnett 2000) as is distributed widely throughout North America,
Central America, and the northern part of South America.  The field
crickets are usually black in color, ½ to 1.25 inches (13 to 33 mm)
long, and more robust than the house cricket.  The rear wings are
projected back beyond the front wings like pointed tails.  Many of
the species can only be separated on the basis of their song.  Mickle
and Walker (1974) provided a useful key to field crickets of the
Southeast.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Field
crickets are the most common cricket found in pastures and meadows
where they are injurious to many field crops, especially alfalfa,
wheat, and oats.  In the Gulf Coast states, they sometimes damage
tomatoes, peas, beans, or strawberries.  They also feed on weakened
crickets and other insects.  They may attack textiles of cotton,
linen, wool, and silk, as well as furs.  Clothing that is stained
with perspiration or food is more prone to injury.  Articles made
from nylon, wood, plastic fabrics, thin rubber goods, and leather
also may be damaged.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Huge
populations occur annually in some areas, plaguing many buildings as
the adult crickets are strongly attracted to exterior lighting. 
Literally thousands of crickets may be found burrowing into any
available crack or harborage, may entering through poorly sealed
doorways and other openings.  The author has observed crickets in
Dallas one summer flying up to the top of tall buildings, even as
high as 30 stories where they served as food for numerous black widow
spiders harboring on the roof.  Thus, infestation in commercial
buildings may originate from the roof as well as the foundation.</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Mackie
(1938) noted that in California the conenose bug, Rasahus thoracius
Stal., is predacious on Gryllidae, and in the vicinity of homes, a
number of cases of Conenose bites to humans were reported.  Calasoma
beetles and the American cockroach also have been observed feeding on
dead and injured crickets.</font></p>

HISTORY.</b></font></font><font face="Avenir Book, serif">  Field
crickets typically produce one generation each year, but in the
southern areas, three generations per year may occur.  Ninety-five
percent of these insects overwinter in the egg stage, 5% as nymphs in
the fifth and sixth instars.  Crickets that overwinter in the egg
stage usually hatch in May, though temperature and rainfall affect
the time of hatching.  They become adults in July and August, mate,
and usually died in September, although some may live until the first
frost.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Two
weeks after becoming an adult,  the female may intermittently lay
eggs for two months or longer, until death ensues.  The eggs are
deposited in the soil at depths of from ¼ to 1 inch (6 to 25 mm). 
Fifty or more eggs may be laid in an areas covering not more than 2
square inches.  The eggs are laid singly with no protective
secretion.  The total number of eggs per female laid ranges from 150
to 400.  The newly emerged nymph can walk, run, and jump immediately
after hatching and passes through eight to 10 instars before molting
into an adult.  The females usually have nine instars and the males
eight; therefore, females become adults later than the males.  The
crickets mature in 78 to 90 days although the range may be from 65 to
102 days.”</font></p>
