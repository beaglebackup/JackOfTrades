Rice
Weevil</h1>
<h2>Sitophilus
oryzae (Linnaeus), Family Curculionidae</h2>

<p>“This
insect is rated by many entomologists as our most important grain
pest, and it is worldwide in distribution.  The rice weevil may have
come originally from India and worldwide in distribution.  The rice
weevil may have come originally from India and spread from there on
commercial byways and highways.  The rice weevil is primarily a pest
in warm countries and is important in the Gulf States and in the
southern United States. 
</p>

<p>A
few of the seed and food products these insects have been reported
infesting include rye, barley, buckwheat, table beans, stored cotton,
grapes, cashew nuts, cereals , wheat products of all kinds (e.g.
pasta), and birdseeds, including corn used in bird control baits. 
This weevil can also injure apples and pears by sucking the juice and
gradually forming cavities in the fruit, within which it then
conceals itself.  The larva must pass its entire larval period within
a single seed or caked flour that must be large enough to permit it
to feed until maturity.</p>

<p><strong>Description.</strong>
 The adults of the rice weevil measure 1/16 to 1/8 inch (2 to 3mm)
and are a dull reddish-brown having the prothorax pitted with deep,
round punctures and with four light spots on the wing covers.  These
light spots are lacking in the closely related granary weevil. 
Another weevil almost identical to the rice weevil is the maize
weevil, Sitophilus zeamais (Mot).  It is, on average, larger in size
and darker in color than S. oryzae.  The round pits on the thorax are
evenly distributed on the maize weevil while on the rice weevil, a
narrow dorsal line void of the round pits is present.  
</p>

<p><strong>Life History.</strong>  The
female eats out a cavity large enough for the egg, then turns,
locates the cavity with the tip of the abdomen, and insets the fleshy
ovipositor.  The deposition of an egg requires only about three
minutes, and the cavity is then sealed over as the ovipositor is
withdrawn.  The female rests a short period before starting another
cavity.  The egg requires three days for hatching at a temperature of
60*F to 65*F (15.6*C to 18.4*C).  Generally, about 50%of the eggs do
not hatch.  The female may deposit eggs at any period of the year
until within a few days of death, but egg laying during the winter is
sporadic and temperature dependent.</p>

<p>The
larva is creamy white with a brownish-black head.  The larva
completes three molts.  Upon transforming to an adult, the insect
will remain in the kernel from three to four days as it hardens and
matures.  Many of the weevils perish when trying to escape from the
exit hold because they become wedged with only the head, legs, and
prothorax free.  In corn, the weevils will at times become so thick
they can be screened out by the literal tons.  In the South, many of
the weevils overwinter in the field, largely within bird damaged ears
of corn.</p>

<p>Both
the rice and the granary weevil feign death by drawing their legs up
close to the body and remaining still.  This habit of feigning death
is much shorter in the rice weevil because the rice weevil has
functional wings with which it can escape by flying.  The granary
weevil must depend upon its ability of feigning death.”</p>
