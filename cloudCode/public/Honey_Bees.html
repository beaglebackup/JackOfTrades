<h1>Honey Bees</h1>
<h2>(Apis mellifera)</h2>

<p><strong>Background Information.</strong>  Honey
bees are social insects that live in colonies of 20,000 to 90,000
individuals. They are considered the most beneficial insect, involved
in the pollination on over 100 different crops and somehow involved
in 80% of American consumed food. They are also responsible for honey
and beeswax. Honey bees are separated into 3 castes, queens (egg
laying females), workers (non-fertile females) and drones (males).  
</p>

<p><strong>Distribution &amp; Habitat.</strong> 
Honey bees are native to Europe, Africa and Asia, but migrated to the
Americas. There are various subspecies depending on location. Beehive
can be manmade or in voids such as hollow trees, wall voids or other
sheltered spaces. 
</p>

<p><strong>Identification.</strong>
 Workers are 0.4 to 0.6 inches in length. They are black or brown
banded with yellow.</p>

<p><strong>Life Cycle.</strong> There is
only one egg producing female per hive, the queen. Males are known as
drones and their only purpose is to mate with virgin queens. Queens
can lay up to 1500 to 2000 eggs per day. Each egg is placed into an
individual cell in a brood comb. Larvae hatch from the eggs in 3-4
days. Workers, non fertile females, develop in about 3 weeks. Drones
have a developmental period of 24 days and queens develop in about 15
days. 
</p>

<p>Drones
typically have very short lifespans and will be kicked out of the
hive during colder months. Workers typically live 5 weeks to 3
months. The queen may live up to 5 years. If the queen dies off, one
of the workers will be fed “royal jelly” which causes the worker
to develop into a fertile queen. 
</p>

<p><strong>Feeding Behavior.</strong>  Workers,
the sterile females, forage for food. The workers collect pollen and
nectar. Bees live on stored honey and pollen during the winter. There
is a specialized storage space behind the legs of the bees called a
“pollen basket” used to transport pollen back to the hive. Nectar
is transported in a specialized part of the digestive system called
the “honey sac”. Pollen is stored in the cells of the comb but
the nectar is converted to honey by the bees. Workers feed the
larvae, queen and drones. 
</p>

<p><strong>Health Concerns.</strong>  The
largest threat bees pose to humans are their stings. Honey bees
typically only sting when provoked. When the bee stings, the stinger,
venom sac, and muscle are torn from the bee and left in the person’s
body. The bee then dies, but venom is continued to eject into the
body. While most people only have a localized reaction to bee stings,
some people can have increased sensitivity to the stings over time.
Some people can react so strongly to bee stings that the result is
anaphylactic shock.
