<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“<font face="Avenir Book, serif">Pediculus
humanus capitis (=Pediculus capitis), the human head louse, is a
small 1/8 inch (1.8-3.3 mm) whitish species with faint dark markings
on the sides.  Female head lice glue small tan eggs (nits) to the
base of hairs, mostly behind the ears and at the nape of the neck. 
An inseminated female lays one to 10 eggs every 24 hours, usually
during darkness or periods of host inactivity.  During her lifetime,
a female will deposit about 80 to 140 eggs.  The female first applies
a bead of gluey substance to the hair and then a few seconds later
deposits a single egg.  Temperature and relative humidity are
critical during the incubation period.  At 84* to 93*F, 70%-90% of
the eggs hatch in seven to nine days.  The egg stage is somewhat more
tolerant of cold than other stages, but egg mortality is high below
65*F and above 97*F.  Even brief exposure at high temperatures is
fatal (Busvine 1977).  Almost immediately after hatching, a nymph
takes its first blood meal and three instar stages are passed in
eight to 12 days.  Adult longevity may be up to 23 days (Nuttall
1917), but average life span is much shorter due to host grooming. 
The head louse is highly dependent on maintaining contact with its
host, feeding several times per day, and cannot survive without a
blood meal for more than one or two days at room temperature (Parish
et al. 1983).  This insect has been around throughout human history
and is cosmopolitan in distribution.</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Head
lice are mainly acquired by direct head-to-head contact with an
infested person’s hair, but may be transferred with shared combs,
hats and other hair accessories (Meinking 1999).  They may also
remain on bedding or upholstered furniture for a brief period.  In
North America and Europe, children are more frequently infested than
are adults, and Caucasians more frequently than other ethnic groups. 
An individual not previously exposed to lice will initially not
experience sensation upon louse feeding, but once sensitized, may
react with sever itching and eczema-like sin eruptions.  Itching may
interfere with sleep.</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Lice
are photophobic and mobile, making them difficult to located among
the hairs.  They are relatively uninfluenced by climate because their
niche is regulated by the host, with constant temperature and
moderately high humidity.  Although they can survive short exposures
to cold and heat, they will not grow or develop at cool temperatures
but require conditions like their on-hose habitat.  They soon starve
to death in the absence of a host.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">The
bottom of the louse egg is glued to the hair shaft by an extremely
persistent cement that retains the empty egg shell along after the
young louse has emerged.  Thus the hair of a previously infested
person may contain numerous nits; though some may be viable, most are
empty and harmless.  Only presence of live lice can confirm diagnosis
of active infestation.  The presence of eggs alone is not sufficient
for diagnosis as eggs may retain a viable appearance for weeks after
death.”</font></p>

Body Lice</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“<font face="Avenir Book, serif">Human
body lice (Pediculus humanus humanus) (=Pediculus humanus corporis,
=Peiculus corporis, =Pediculus vestimenti) are closely related to
head lice, but are less frequently encountered in the United Staes. 
The body louse is grayish in color and larger (1/7-inch; 3.0-4.2 mm)
than the head louse.  These lice infest humans, hiding in clothing
seams and folds, contacting the host’s body only when feeding. 
Body louse eggs are glued to clothing fibers in the same way head
louse eggs are glued to hair.  Lice tend to aggregate along seams
inside the garment next to the skin, producing large concentrations
of eggs.  The female louse depositions four to five eggs per day, for
a lifetime total of 50-150 eggs.  At a termperature of 75*F the eggs
hatch in seven to 11 days (Leeson 1941); at lower and higher
temperatures {99*F or greater] eggs do not develop or are killed. 
The nymphs mature in 11 days and the complete life cycle takes about
three weeks.  All stages will die within 30 days of leaving the host.
 They move off as the body cools after death, and may gravitate away
from the body if the temperature rises in fever.  Body lice are
acquired mainly through direct contact with an infested person or
their clothing and bedding, and are most commonly found on
individuals who infrequently change or wash their clothes.  A change
into clean cloths, and laundering of infested garments (especially
drying with high heat or ironing), are generally effective in
eliminating an infestation.</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">As
with all bloodsucking arthropods, the host reaction is more a feature
of the host’s physiology than of any variation of the parasites. 
Pruritus due to louse saliva ranges from slight irritation to severe
urticarial.  Prolonged infestation results in a thickening of the
skin with pigmentation changes known as ‘vagabond disease.’
Irritation caused by louse bites may interfere with sleep and
scratching may lead to infection of the abrasions.</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Body
lice serve as vectors of certain human pathogens, including
rickettsiae of epidemic typhus (Rickettsia prowazekii) and trench
fever (Bartonella Quintana) and the spirocahetes of relapsing fever
(Borrelia recurrentis).  Interestingly, none of these disease
organisms are transmitted by the louse feeding, but are instead
introduced into the bloodstream by the host scratching contaminated
materials into the skin.</font></p>

or Crab Lice</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">The
pubic Louse (Pthirus pubis) (=Pthirius pubis=Phithirus pubis) has a
short crab-like body, whitish with a dusky patch on each shoulder,
well-developed claws, and pale reddish legs.  The broadly oval body
is about 1/16-inch (1.5 to 2.0 mm) long.  Pubic lice are most
frequently found around the pubic region of the infested person, but
may also be found elsewhere on the body (armpits or other coarse hair
such as beards or eyebrows).  Infestation by pubic lice is termed
pthiriasis.  The egg is smaller than that of Pediculus, and is glued
to body hair.  Female pubic lice produce approximately three eggs a
day, and generation time is about 20 to 25 days.  All stages are more
sedentary than Pedsiculus, tending to settle in one spot, grasping
hairs with the legs of both sides of the body, inserting mouthparts,
and taking blood intermittently for many hours at a time.  The legs
are adapted to grasping large hairs and best positioned for rather
widely spaced hairs, explaining its predilection for the pubic
region.   Because pubic lice are acquired mainly through sexual
contact, their presence may be associated with other sexually
transmitted disease.  Pubic lice on a child may cause the physician
to consider the possibility that the more innocent means, such as by
sharing a bed with an infested person.  Bites can cause severe itch
but pubic lice do not transmit disease agents.  Crab lice die within
24 hours after being removed from the host.  </font>
