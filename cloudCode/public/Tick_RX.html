<p><strong>Control of fowl ticks.</strong>  Considerable control in poultry operations can be achieved through a high level of sanitation and exclusion efforts aimed at broken, cracked floors and walls and other cracks and crevices.  When chemical control is required, considerable success has been achieved in the past with malathion, although pyrethroid insecticides are increasingly being used for pest control in poultry operations.  Control efforts in residences should focus on finding and treating cracks and voids where ticks are harboring during the day.  A perimeter treatment may be necessary when these ticks are found to be invading from the exterior.<p>

<p><strong>Control of the Pigeon Tick.</strong>  Control measure include discouraging roosting on the building, clean up of droppings and nesting sites, and the sealing of cracks and crevices where the various life stages may hide.  Supplementary treatment of cracks and voids used as harborages and perimeters treatments to prevent entry are effective and often necessary.<p>

<p><strong>Control of Relapsing Fever Ticks.</strong>  Rodent proofing of structures to exclude rodent hosts of ticks is eessential, as is elimination of rodent populations within the building.  To clear structures already infested with these ticks, the procedures recommended below for the brown dog tick should prove effective.<p>

<p><strong>Control of the Brown dog tick.</strong>  For this particular tick, application of residual insecticides will be required more than nonchemical measures.  Recognizing that this is a pest not of the fields and woods, but rather only of areas which dogs frequent, provides opportunities for complete elimination of the ticks in and around a particular building.  Strict leash and confinement laws in urban areas can be useful for more than the protection of the citizenry from dog bites.  Freely roaming infested dogs can drop all active life stages of this tick wherever they may roam.  Concerted community action can prevent this activity.  Pesticide applications, possibly coordinated with neighbors will likely be necessary.  Maintenance of weed- adn brush-free premises, as well as properly mowed lawns, will help to forestall tick population buildup and result in a reduced need for insecticide applications.<p>

The proper strategy when using insecticides for brown dog tick control is for the treatment of the animal, the residence, other structure the animal may frequent, and the surrounding grounds to be conducted on the same day.  Treatment of the animal is the owner's or a veterinarian's responsibility; pest management professionals should not undertake this task.<p>

Treatment of structures and gounds must be comprehensive and should be completed by a licensed, certified commercial applicator.  Larvae and nymphs of this tick are often found crawling up walls; therefore a successful treatment should include higher areas as well as the floor and lowe wall level.  It is important not to forget treatment of crawlspaces, especially if the dog has access to them.  The primary treatment should be the application of a dust insecticide to cracks and voids where ticks could be haroring.  Dust, such as silica gel or a pyrethroid, can be applied behind the baseboards, window and door frames, cracks in furniture, and around doors and windows outside.  Spot treatments using almost any appropriately labeled residual insecticdie are useful in areas of activity, especially when combined with crack and crevice treatments.  Upholstered furniture where dogs rest may contain ticks and will require applications of both crack and cravice and spot treatments.  In crawlspaces, dust insecticides are applied lightly to cracks or surfaces where ticks may be active.  In each case, only properly labeled insecticides should be used for each type of treatment site.<p>

If the homeowner has done everything possible, but neighbors seem unwilling to cooperate, periodic perimeter treatment of a band about 10 feet (3 cm) wide aroudn the foundation may help prevent future invasions inside.  If complete treatment of the home, yard, and pet is required, one retreatment of the entire premises, structure and pet, approximately a month later, may be required to eliminate larvae and nymphs hatched from eggs not affected by teh initial application.  Continued inspection of the dog(s) followed by proper tick removal and treatment of the animal will be necessary to prevent renewed infestation inside the home.<p>
