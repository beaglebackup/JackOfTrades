<h1>Little Black Ant</h1>
<h2>Monomorium minimum (Buckley)</h2>
<h2>Subfamily Myrmicinae</h2>

<p><strong>Identifying Characteristics.</strong> 
Workers are monomorphic and small, 1.5 to 2 mm in length.  Their
antennae are 12 segmented with a three segmented club.  They are dark
brown to black and have a shiny appearance.</p>

<p><strong>Distribution.</strong>
 This ant is found in the northeastern U.S. to the Pacific Coast and
south-central U.S. from west Tennessee to central Texas (Hedges
1997).</p>

<p><strong>Biology &amp; Habits.</strong> 
Colonies may contain several queens and be heavily populated (Wheeler
and Wheeler 1986).  Alates have been recorded from June to August
(Smith 1965).  The little black ant is common in wooded habitats. 
Most infestations originate from outdoors and can be traced to a
stump, tree, log, fence, or a pile of lumber or bricks.  They also
nest in landscape mulch and under stones.  Hedges (1997) inspected
one home where trails of little black ants ringed the house, entering
it from multiple locations.  A careful inspection revealed that the
trail originated from a nearby tree.  Indoors colonies may nest in
the voids of walls and cabinets, as well as within and behind
foundations and brick or stone veneer.</p>

<p>The
little black ant feeds on insects, honeydew, plant exudates, pollen,
and may even kill hatchling birds (Smith 1965).  It also feeds on
bird feces (Hedges 1997).  Indoors, little black ants feed on a
variety of foods including sweets, meats, grease, bread, oils,
cornmeal, fruits, and fruit juices (Smith 1965).</p>
