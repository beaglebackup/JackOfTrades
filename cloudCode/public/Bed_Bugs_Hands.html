managers can prevent pest harborage by addressing any structural
deficiencies, especially cracks and crevices. &nbsp;Bed bugs can fit
in an area narrow enough to fit a credit card. &nbsp;By sealing up
cracks and crevices the number of places bed bugs have to hide are
reduced, making detection and treatment much easier. </span></font></font><font color="#222222"><font face="Chalkboard, serif"><b><span style="background: #ffffff">&nbsp;</span></b></font></font><font color="#222222"><font face="Chalkboard, serif"><span style="background: #ffffff">Specific
attention should be paid to the baseboards and carpet edges, although
any structural deficiencies creating small openings should be
addressed for bed bugs as well as other pests. In multi-unit
buildings, bed bug infestations can spread to other locations via
active transport through wall voids at electrical outlets, pipe
opening and heating ducts. While these typically can’t be sealed
closed, any deficiencies (cracked plating, excessive opening, etc.)
should be noted and corrected. </span></font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font color="#222222"><font face="Chalkboard, serif"><span style="background: #ffffff">Mattress
and box spring encasements are also a type of pest proofing.
Encasements remove potential harborage areas by providing a flat
surface, instead of the numerous hiding spaces on mattresses or in
box springs. Encasements are typically bright white in color and make
any bed bugs or evidence easily visible. If there are any current bed
bugs harboring on the mattress or box spring, encasements seal them
in and prevent them from feeding. Climbup interceptors are also
considered prevention since they don’t allow bed bugs to access the
bed from other points in the room. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></font></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font color="#222222"><font face="Chalkboard, serif"><span style="background: #ffffff">Bed
bugs are attracted to body heat and carbon dioxide not poor
sanitation, but clutter does drastically increase the number of
places for bed bugs to harbor. Clutter reduction, especially in the
bed area, is always recommended for preventing and controlling bed
bug infestation. Items should not be stored under the bed. Any items
that are stored near the bed should not be stored in cardboard, but
instead should be in locking plastic containers as they reduce
harborage areas. </span></font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font color="#222222"><font face="Chalkboard, serif"><span style="background: #ffffff">The
best way to prevent bringing a bed bug infestation is through
education and conscious preventative precautions on the part of the
tenant. Bed bugs can come from a number of locations, including (but
not limited to) hotels, theaters, libraries, offices, public
transportation, used furniture/clothing items, and infested
residential locations. Extra precautions should be taken in these
locations, including visually inspecting furniture before sitting on
it, not putting personal bags on furniture, and bagging and
laundering any clothing items worn as soon as arriving home. If bed
bug are known to be in other units of the building, non infested
units should install interceptors and encasements for prevention and
early detection.</span></font></font></p>
