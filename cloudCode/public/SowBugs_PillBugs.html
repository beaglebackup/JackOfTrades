“<font face="Avenir Book, serif">Sowbugs and pillbugs, often called
isopods, are the only crustaceans that have become completely adapted
to terrestrial habitats.  They have oval bodies, convex above and
flat or hollow beneath, and they rarely reach more than ¾ inch (19
mm) in length.  The head and abdomen are small, but the thorax is
comparatively large, composed of seven hardened individual, but
overlapping, plates.  Both isopods have seven pairs of legs with the
large pair appearing only after the first molt.  </font>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">The
common pillbug, Armadillium vulgare (Latreille); the dooryard sowbug,
Porcellio laevis Koch; and P. scaber (Latreille) are worldwide in
distribution.  They prefer moist locations and are found under
objects on the damp ground, as well as under vegetable debris of all
kinds, and in rare instances, they become pests of young plants. 
They are usually most active at night, and at times, sowbugs and
pillbugs may even bury themselves several inches into the soil.</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Sowbugs
can be identified by their two prominent tail-like appendages and the
fact that they cannot roll up into a tight ball like the pill bug. 
Sowbugs and pillbugs occasionally invade damp basement areas, as well
as the first floors of houses.  When this occurs, they are often
present in considerable numbers in the soil and under plants
immediately outside the foundation.  These crustaceans normally feed
on decaying vegetable matter.  They become inactive during the winter
months, although in artificially heated buildings, such as green
houses, activity may occur year-round.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Hatchett
(1947) studied the biology of several species of isopods in Michigan.
 He noted that “isopods are considered to be gravid when they are
carrying eggs, embryos or young in their marsupial.  The period of
gravidity, therefore, extends from the time the eggs are first
deposited in the marsupium until the young leave it.”  However,
this period is quite variable since  the young may leave of their own
violation.  Thus, Porcellio scaber and Armadillium vulgare may carry
the brood for an average of 44 and 43 days, respectively.  The
females may bear two or more broods per year.  P. Scaber averaged 28
young and A. vulgare 24 young per brood.  Usually one or two
generations occur per year, varying with environmental conditions.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">According
to Hatchett (1947), an isopod molts for the first time within 24
hours after leaving the marsupium.  Second and third molts occur
during the second and third weeks respectively.  Beginning with the
fourth instar, molts occur every two weeks until the anthropod is 20
weeks old.  After this age, the period between molts is irregular. 
Many sowbugs live to be two years old.”</font></p>
