	<p><h6>Sanitation.</h6>  "Like all animals cockroaches need food and water to survive in and around structures.  By reducing access to food and water, cockroach populations become stressed to survive in urban environments (Jackson and Marsh) 1978.</p>

	<p><h6>Harborage Alteration.</h6>  In conjunction with food and water, harborage is the third essential element for cockroaches to survive.  Predominately indoor pests, such as German cockroaches and brownbanded cockroaches, can abound in cluttered homes and apartments.  CLutter is excellent harborage for cockroaches and often provides areas of high humidity that are difficult to clean and access (Koehler et al 1987).</p>

	<p><h6>Exclusion.</h6>  Keeping pests from entering a structure from the outside is known as exclusion.  This key component of IPM is generally accomplished by sealing cracks and removing entry points used by peridomestic cockroaches."</p>
