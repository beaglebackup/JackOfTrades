 For nearly half a century, the only thing most Americans knew about
bed bug was the simple nursery rhyme, “Good night, sleep tight.
Don’t let the bedbugs bite.” Many people didn’t know they
existed until the last 10-15 years when they became a growing
problem. But bed bugs have been around since early man. Fossilized
bed bug remains have been found from as far back as 1350 BC in Egypt.
In the 1940s, DDT made wide scale pesticide use common practice,
which tampered the bed bug population in the United States and many
other first world countries. The reason for the reemergence of bed
bugs isn’t entirely clear, but it’s likely a combination of
factors including travel from locations where bed bugs were never
eradicated, increase in used furniture exchange and changes in pest
management practices. </font>

&amp; HABITAT.</b></font></font><font face="Avenir Book, serif">  Bed
bugs come from the family Cimicidae, a group of 92 different small,
flat, wingless insects that feed on blood. 16 of those species have
been found in the continental United State and Canada. There are two
species of bed bugs, the Common Bed Bug (Cimex lectularius) and the
Tropical Bed Bug (Cimex hemipterus). The Common bed bug is found in
all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico. The Tropical bed bug
prefers warmer climates, and their North American distribution
includes Florida and Puerto Rico. The primary species of the San
Francisco Bay Area is the Common bed bug. </font>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Bed
bugs tend to live in clusters, using pheromones to attract
aggregations. Bed bugs typically harbor within 8 feet of their host
animal, humans. In most cases, this is around the bed area, although
if beds are not available the bed bugs will adapt.  Bed bugs are
light sensitive, and tend to harbor in cracks and crevices when they
are not feeding. Because of their flat shape, bed bugs are able to
fit in a space narrow enough to fit a business card. They generally
prefer rough, dry surfaces like wood or paper. Bed bugs do not
typically spend long periods of time on their host and will move away
after feeding to prevent being killed. In very high levels of
infestation, bed bugs can harbor on their host’s clothing.</font></p>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Bed
bugs are dispersed in two ways, passive and active transport. In
their attempt to search for protected areas between feedings, bed
bugs will hide in bags or suitcases and leave the bags after they
have been deposited in a new location. Often customers will report
bed bugs after bringing used furniture items in their house. These
bugs are considered hitchhikers that enter a new location based on
opportunity. In active transport, the bed bugs are actively seeking
out a new location. After mating, females will often leave the
grouping of bed bugs to recover from and prevent the future trauma of
mating. In high levels of infestation, bed bugs will seek out a new
food source if the population has become too large. This can be a
problem in multi-unit buildings, when bed bugs begin infesting other
units. </font>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Identification.
 Adult bed bugs are flat, oval and wingless, typically ranging from
1/6” to 1/4” long and 1/8” wide. They are reddish brown in
color, and are darker after they have recently fed. They are often
described as being similar in appearance (size, shape and color) to
an apple seed. Bed bug nymphs, the pre-adult phases, have the same
shape and structure as adult bed bugs but are smaller and
translucent. Bed bugs often emit a “buggy” smell, sometimes
described as musty, sweetish, or even like raspberries. </font>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Bed
bug infestations are identified by the presence of bed bugs as well
as bed bug evidence. Bed bugs leave reddish brown to black fecal
staining in their harborage areas, and are one of the easiest ways to
detect a bed bug infestation.  Between each growth phase, bed bugs
molt their exoskeletons. These molted cast skins are also evidence of
bed bug activity, as well as the presence of eggs. </font>

CYCLE.</b></font></font><font face="Avenir Book, serif">  Bed bugs
reproduce through a method called traumatic insemination. While
females have typical genitalia, males use their specialized paramere
to puncture the female’s side. The sperm migrates to the female’s
primary reproductive tract. The males penetrate a specific site on
the female. When she is unfed, he is able to protect this area, but
when she is fed and bloated she is unable to protect this area.
Females are able to prepare for mating by “turning on” their
immune system a day or so before feeding. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Once
a female has been inseminated, the female begins laying eggs. These
eggs are white and cylindrical, about 1mm long. These eggs are held
in place by a sticky white secretion from the female. Females lay
about one to five eggs per day, laying up to 200-500 eggs in her
lifetime. A blood meal is required prior to egg production. These
eggs take about 6-10 days to hatch.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">After
the eggs have hatched, the bed bugs go through 5 nymphal instars
before they become adults. These nymphal stages look like the adult
phase, but smaller and translucent. Between each phase, they must
have a blood meal and then molt their exoskeleton. The average time
it takes for the bed bugs to go through the developmental phase under
the ideal temperature and food availability. In ideal conditions,
83°-90° F and steady blood source, it takes about 4 weeks to go
from egg to adult. Four generations of bed bugs can be produced in a
year. </font>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">The
average lifespan of a bed bug is also dependent on temperature and
access to a blood meal. In ideal conditions, bed bugs can live around
316 days. If temperatures are too low (usually below 61°F), bed bugs
can become inactive. Adult bed bugs can go several months without
food. Some studies have indicated that bed bugs can survive up to 18
months without food, although new estimates suggest only about 6
months. Some scientists believe that genetic changes that allow for
pesticide resistance have been a trade-off for long-term lifespan. </font>

BEHAVIOR.</b></font></font><font face="Avenir Book, serif">  Bed bugs
are sanguivores, animals that feed solely on blood. They feed
primarily on humans, although will feed on other mammals or bird in
the absence of a human host.  Bed bugs are nocturnal, although if
their host is on a differential sleep pattern (a person who works
nights and sleep during the day, etc.) bed bugs will alter their
feeding pattern. Bed bugs are able to sense body heat and carbon
dioxide production to determine when the host is in the deepest level
of sleep. By waiting until the person is in a deep sleep, the bed bug
minimizes the risk of being killed by the host.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Bed
bugs use a specialized mouth part called a proboscis. They inject
this proboscis into their host’s skin. The proboscis has two
chambers, one that injects anesthetic and anticoagulants into the
host while the other draws the blood. Bed bugs bite 1 to 3 times per
feeding session while searching for the optimum location to feed.
This pattern of bites is often referred to “breakfast, lunch and
dinner”. Bed bugs bite on exposed skin, usually the arms, legs,
trunk, neck or face. Bed bugs don’t bite through clothing and avoid
hair covered areas of a person to decrease detection. Once they have
found the prime area for feeding, bed bugs will engorge themselves
with blood. This takes an average for 5-10 minutes. After the bugs
have fed, the bed bugs will return to their hiding areas.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">The
frequency of feeding is dependent on temperature, humidity and food
source availability. On average, in ideal conditions, adult bed bugs
feed every 3-4 days.  During development, nymphs can feed daily. </font>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Health
Concerns.  Reactions to bed bug bites are allergic reactions to bed
bug saliva that is injected into the host during feeding. Each person
reacts differently to bites, with the potential for increased or
decreased sensitivity over time. Some people never react to bed bug
bites, and it is not uncommon for two people to be sleeping in the
same bed and one receives bites while the other does not.  Because of
the wide range of reactions to bites, bed bugs should never be
diagnosed based solely on the bite pattern. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Bed
bugs have been known to carry up to 32 different pathogens, but have
not been found to transmit any of them. This is likely because of the
two chambers in the bed bug’s proboscis prevents anything going
into the host from mixing with anything coming out of it.  The Center
for Disease Control (CDC) says that they are not considered a medical
or public health threat. The only potential medical threat is
secondary skin infections caused by scratching for people with highly
sensitive reactions.  Blood loss is not considered a potential
threat, since 30,000 to 40,000 bugs would need to feed on a person to
lose 8 ounces of blood.  Bites can cause emotional reactions such as
stress, anxiety and lack of sleep. </font>

nightstands, baseboards, ceiling lines, crown molding, dressers,
couches, chairs, closets and any personal items stored in and around
these areas. In commercial and government locations inspections can
also include: waiting area seating, reception desks, office chairs,

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Because
bed bugs’ natural instinct is to hide in cracks and crevices,
inspections should be in-depth. For sanitary reasons, technicians
should always wear gloves while inspecting customers’ belongings.
Flashlights should be utilized in order to see into potential
harborage areas. Hand mirrors allow for visual inspection in areas
that may not otherwise be able to be easily visually inspected (in
carpet edges, at crown molding, behind non-movable items, etc.). </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Bed
bugs typically harbor within 8 feet of their food source, and as
their name suggests, are usually found in the bed and bed area. In
most residential calls, the beds should be the primary focus of the
inspection. Technicians should begin by inspecting the bed linens. In
heavier infestations, bed bugs may be found topically on the bedding,
but in lower level infestations evidence is more likely blood
smearing or staining and black fecal stains. Technicians bag bed
linens for customers to launder them after treatment in hot water and
dry items on high heat. The mattress should then be inspected along
all seam lines. After the mattress has been moved off of the bed, the
box spring is then inspected. Box springs offer a high level of
harborage locations for bed bugs because of their ample hiding space.
With the customer’s permission, the technician should remove the
dust cover and inspect the inside of the box spring. The plastic
protective corners found on many box springs also are potential
harborage sites, and should be inspected. Once the box spring has
been inspected, it is then removed and the technician then inspects
the entire bed frame, taking care to inspect cracks, bed slats,
joints and screw holes. Wood frames are more susceptible to
infestation since they offer more harborage locations, although metal
frames can harbor bed bugs as well. After inspection, the bed is
reassembled for the customer. </font>

first step in any inspection is to prepare the room. The room is
cleared of any hazards or distractions. This includes other animals,
food, or any medications on the floor. Any windows should be closed
and fans or air conditioning turned off to reduce air movement in the
room. At this time, the technician should also perform a hand/visual
inspection of the suspected areas. This helps to ensure that the dog
is not missing any evidence during their inspection or looks for

are not a good option for long term monitoring, but are good for
locations suspected of having bed bugs that don’t have overnight
residents, like offices, or spaces being treated where the regular
tenant is not sleeping there. </font>

 Some pest proofing practices can inhibit the harborage and spread of
bed bugs, although most prevention for bed bugs is mostly cultural
and based upon the practices of the people inhabiting the space.</font></p>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Property
managers can prevent pest harborage by addressing any structural
deficiencies, especially cracks and crevices.  Bed bugs can fit in an
area narrow enough to fit a credit card.  By sealing up cracks and
crevices the number of places bed bugs have to hide are reduced,
making detection and treatment much easier.  Specific attention
should be paid to the baseboards and carpet edges, although any
structural deficiencies creating small openings should be addressed
for bed bugs as well as other pests. In multi-unit buildings, bed bug
infestations can spread to other locations via active transport
through wall voids at electrical outlets, pipe opening and heating
ducts. While these typically can’t be sealed closed, any
deficiencies (cracked plating, excessive opening, etc.) should be
noted and corrected. </font>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Mattress
and boxspring encasements are also a type of pest proofing.
Encasements remove potential harborage areas by providing a flat
surface, instead of the numerous hiding spaces on mattresses or in
box springs. Encasements are typically bright white in color and make
any bed bugs or evidence easily visible. If there are any current bed
bugs harboring on the mattress or box spring, encasements seal them
in and prevent them from feeding. Climbup interceptors are also
considered prevention since they don’t allow bed bugs to access the
bed from other points in the room.   </font>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Bed
bugs are attracted to body heat and carbon dioxide not poor
sanitation, but clutter does drastically increase the number of
places for bed bugs to harbor. Clutter reduction, especially in the
bed area, is always recommended for preventing and controlling bed
bug infestation. Items should not be stored under the bed. Any items
that are stored near the bed should not be stored in cardboard, but
instead should be in locking plastic containers as they reduce
harborage areas. </font>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">The
best way to prevent bringing a bed bug infestation is through
education and conscious preventative precautions on the part of the
tenant. Bed bugs can come from a number of locations, including (but
not limited to) hotels, theaters, libraries, offices, public
transportation, used furniture/clothing items, and infested
residential locations. Extra precautions should be taken in these
locations, including visually inspecting furniture before sitting on
it, not putting personal bags on furniture, and bagging and
laundering any clothing items worn as soon as arriving home. If bed
bug are known to be in other units of the building, non infested
units should install interceptors and encasements for prevention and
early detection.</font></p>

 </b></font></font><font face="Avenir Book, serif">The IPM approach
for bed bugs differs greatly from traditional pest control practices
of blanket spraying of toxic chemicals, instead focusing on a multi
approach method. Each treatment is targeted to the specific
infestation and the needs of the location. There are two main types
of treatment, Manual Treatments and Thermal Remediation. Both used a
combination of biological, cultural, mechanical, physical and
chemical control, although they approach the infestation in different
ways. Manual treatments focus on protecting the bed and draining the
population over time, whereas thermal remediation treats the entire
infestation at once. Both are effective treatments, but often one is
better suited to a location than another. </font>

TREATMENT.</font></font><font face="Avenir Book, serif">  Manual
treatments are a minimum 3-5 visit service used to drain the
population over time. Manual treatments are ideal for lower level
infestations, as well as when thermal treatment ability is restricted
or cost is a factor. For manual treatments to be effective, the
tenant must be cooperative with recommendations of the technicians. </font>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Technicians
begin by removing any live bed bugs or eggs. Inspection notes can
help determine where the infestation is located, but additional hand
inspection will help ensure that nothing is missed. For larger
infestations, a vacuum can be used.</font></p>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Any
areas found harboring bed bugs or any items that are likely to harbor
bed bugs are then treated for bed bugs. Furniture items, carpet lines
and curtains can be treated with steam. Because of its high
temperature, steam is an instant contact killer. To ensure proper
heat penetration, steam is applied at a rate of 20 seconds per linear
foot. Items can also be treated with a reduced-risk pesticide labeled
for the location being treated. The current pesticide used for
targeting bed bugs are Best Yet Cedarcide, Cimexa,  Cirkil RTU,
Cirkil CX, Phantom, and Temprid.</font></p>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Once
the bed has been cleared of bugs, it is then protected to ensure that
no new bugs are able to access the bed. This is done through the
installation of Climbup Interceptors and encasements. These ensure
that the bed bugs aren’t able to get to their host, the human
sleeping in the bed. If bed bugs can’t feed, they cannot grow and
reproduce. This allows to tenants to stop receiving bites after the
first visit and drains the population over time. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">The
next goal is to stop the bed bugs as they move throughout the room
and prevent them from traveling to other parts of the house or other
units. The technician applies an insecticidal dust at the baseboards
and in the wall voids. The predominant insecticidal dust is a
variation of Diatomaceous Earth with different additives. These dusts
are crushed up diatoms with sharp edges that destroy the waxy coating
of the bed bugs so they lose all the moisture in their body.
Insecticidal dusts are only applied in very fine amounts with a hand
duster; if it is visible there is too much product. Bed bugs will
avoid any large patches of dust and the product will not be
effective. Trapper monitors should also be installed at this time to
monitor pest movement between visits. </font>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">The
tenant responsibilities and impacts in a manual treatment are
minimal, but they do need to be followed in order for treatment to be
effective. During each treatment the technicians will bag all bed
linens. The tenant must launder them in hot water and dry them on
high prior to putting them back on the bed. The tenant must keep the
bed 4-6 inches away from the wall and other furniture items and keep
all bedding off the floor if interceptors are installed. Clutter
should be reduced around the bed area and no items should be stored
under the bed. If treatment services are ineffective due to
non-compliance of technician recommendations on the customer’s
part, additional fees can be accrued. </font>

REMEDIATION.</b></font></font><font face="Avenir Book, serif">  In
higher levels of infestation or for customers looking for a chemical
free option, thermal remediation uses high levels of heat to treat an
entire space for bed bugs. Live bed bugs and eggs are instantly
killed at 122° F. The goal of thermal remediation is to raise the
temperature of a space using large heaters and holding the
temperature there for several hours. </font>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Thermal
remediation first begins with a pre-treatment. The space is treated
in the same manner as a manual treatment, removing and treating for
as many bugs in the space as possible. At this time, the technicians
will also advise the customer on items that need to be removed prior
to treatment. While the temperature range of the thermal remediation
process shouldn’t damage most items in the home, some items are
more heat sensitive and need to be removed to prevent damage. This
includes perishable food items, medications, candles, oil paintings,
antique furniture and stringed instruments. Some items can be stored
in the refrigerator while others need to be inspected by a technician
and removed from the site prior to treatment. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">The
wall voids are dusted with insecticidal dust. This prevents the bed
bugs from seeking cooler locations during treatment. This is
especially important in multi-unit buildings to prevent spreading the
infestation into other units. The faceplates are removed from
electrical outlets and dust is applied inside. In more extreme cases,
additional wall voids are created with drills and dust is applied
there as well. </font>

hours and the tenants and any pets are not allowed in the unit during
this time. Once the unit has been brought up to temperature, either
with heaters in the unit or air being channeled in from outside the
unit, large fans are plugged in to circulate the air throughout the
entire unit. After the temperature has leveled off at lethal
temperature again, the unit is held at that temperature for several
hours. The technicians will rotate larger items periodically to
ensure even heat distribution. Tenants may return to their unit after
treatment, although typically the unit will retain heat for several
hours. 	</font></p>

 </b></font></font><font face="Avenir Book, serif">For manual
treatments, follow-ups are inspection and re-treatment as needed. The
purpose of the treatment is to protect the bed and drain the
population over time. Finding bed bugs in monitors and the outer
rings of interceptors is common. If bugs are being found on the bed,
treatment methods need to be assessed. Follow-ups for thermal
remediation are typically K9 inspection and chemical re-treatments
are offered if any bed bug activity is found. In both cases, units
are considered cleared of bed bugs once they have had two consecutive
visits without any bed bug activity found. The final visit should be
done with a canine to most accurately determine if there are any more
bed bugs. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Services
are scheduled two weeks apart, per the San Francisco Department of
Public Health’s bed bug guidelines. Most IPM approved pesticides
don’t kill bed bug eggs and the average span of time between a bed
bug egg being laid to hatched is about two weeks.  Scheduling
follow-ups two weeks apart allows for newly hatched bed bugs to be
detected and killed before they can reproduce.  Follow-ups can, and
should, be scheduled sooner if the tenant is reporting bites or any
live bed bugs. </font>

the unit is cleared of bed bugs, there is a 30 day monitoring period.
If any bed bugs are found during that time, re-treatment is free of
charge. After that period, and inspections or treatments are
considered  a new service. If bed bugs are a continuing problem in a
location, tenant habits should be assessed and a higher value should
be placed on education and prevention. </font>
