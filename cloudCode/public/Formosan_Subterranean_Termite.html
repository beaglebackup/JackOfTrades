<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“<font face="Avenir Book, serif">This
subterranean termite is the most aggressive and potentially
destructive termite species in the United States.  In areas where it
has become established, C. formosanus has gained notoriety as a
devastating pest of structures, often displacing other native
subterranean species.  As a result, the Formosan termite has
attracted a great deal of media attention and is worthy of more
in-depth discussion.  </font>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">The
Formosan subterranean termite is so named because it was first
described in Taiwan (otherwise known as Formosa) in the early 1900s. 
The termite is believed to originate from southern China, and
apparently was transported to Japan before the 1600s.  It arrived in
Hawaii more than a century ago, and is thought to have reached the
U.S. mainland in the mid-1940s on military ships returning from the
Pacific during World War II.  In 1965, a pest control operator in
Houston, Texas, found C. formosanus in a shipyard warehouse in
Houston.  The following year it was also discovered in Galveston,
Texas, and in New Orleans and Lake Charles, La. (Beal 1967). 
Infestations have since been discovered in 11 states (Alabama,
California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, North
and South Carolia, Tennessee, and Texas).  Initial infestations of C.
formosanus were found in coastal areas, presumably from infested
ships or cargo.  The termite has since been transported inland and
limited infestations have been discovered as far north as Memphis,
Tenn., Atlanta, Ga., and the Appalachian Mountain foothills in North
Carolina.  Most of these inland infestations have been traced to the
shipment of infested wood products, particularly recycled railroad
ties used in landscaping (Woodson et al. 2001; Forschler et al.
2001).  It is difficult to predict how widespread their termite may
ultimately become.  Winter temperatures at locations north of
Memphis, Tenn. (35* N Latitude) are thought to be too low for
permanent establishment (Su and Scheffrahn 1990b).  Nonetheless, the
Formosan termite infestation in southern California appears to be
expanding, despite environmental conditions presumed to be less than
ideal for its survival (Haagsma et al. 1995).</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Although
its distribution is more limited than some Reticulitermes species,
the Formosan subterranean termite poses a severe threat in areas
where it is established.  In Hawaii, this termite can cause major
structural damage to a home in six months, and almost complete
destruction within two years (Tamashiro 1984).  In Louisiana, loss
estimates approach $500 million, more than half occurring in the New
Orleans area (Ring et al 2001).  In the Southeast, field colonies
commonly extend into the millions, foraging over distances in excess
of 100 meters.  Compared to the aforementioned species of
Reticulitermes, Formosan termites generally cause more structural
damage in a shorter period of time – primarily because populations
tend to be larger – not because populations tend to be larger –
not because individual termites eat wood faster (Su and Scheffrahn
2000).  Population surveys in Florida indicated that C. Formosanus
colonies tended to replace R. flavipes when foraging territories of
both species overlapped (Su and Scheffrahn) 1988b).</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Although
C. formosanus ordinarily has colonies traceable to the soil, it may
also form aerial nests with no ground connection.  The nests are made
of a material known as “carton,” consisting of soil and
masticated wood cemented together with saliva and excrement.  The
nest carton helps to conserve water.  Aboveground nests are often
constructed in walls, attics, and roof areas of buildings.  Walls
often bulge outward as a result of the carton, which may be larger
than a basketball. </font>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Aerial
infestations accound for about 25% of structural infestations by C.
Formosanus in urban southeastern Florida (Su and Scheffrahn 1986b)
and more than 50% of the high-rise buildings in Honolulu, Hawaii
(Tamashiro et al. 1987).  As with native subterranean species, true
aerial infestations require remote moisture source, such as leaking
roofs, faulty plumbing, or condensation from air conditioning units
(Chambers et al. 1988).  Moisture also appears to be precondition for
nest founding by alates (Fei and Henderson 1999).  Su et al. (1989)
confirmed that Formosan termite swarmers are capable of re-infesting
multi-story buildings by being carried upward on flat roofs by wind
currents.  Crevices in the roof surface allow moisture to accumulate
and provide an entry point for the winged reproductive.  Additional
measure often must be taken to find and eradicate aerial nests,
including removal and/or spot treatment of cartons or, in some cases,
whole-structure fumigation.</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Successful
control of this formidable species requires proper identification. 
Formosan termite swarmers are larger than other subterranean species
[1/2 inch (12-15mm) in length], and the body is yellowish brown.  The
wings are pale yellow and densely covered with tiny hairs.  Swarming
occurs on calm, humid evenings beginning around sundown.  The
swarmers are attracted to lights, with very large warms often seen
around streetlights or the lights of buildings.  In areas of
Louisiana, “the exodus is so massive that baseball games have been
canceled das the swarming insects gather by the lights” (Goyer and
Henderson 1992).</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">The
soldiers are also distinctive, the head being teardrop or oval shaped
rather than elongated like most Reticulitermes species.  Formosan
termite soldiers also have a pore-like opening called a “fotanelle”
on the fore margin of the head.  When mud tubes or galleries are
disturbed, the soldiers readily attack approaching objects (including
one’s finger), and may emit a milky-white, sticky fluid from the
fontanelle opening which can hinder the movement of enemies. 
Formosan termite colonies are also notable in having a higher
proportion of solidiers (10%-15%), compared to most Reticulitermes
species (1%-2%).</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Besides
infesting buildings, Formosan subterranean termites are serous pests
of utility poles and railroad ties, often requiring removal and
replacement.  They have also been implicated in causing costly
repairs and large-scale power outages in cities by eating through the
insulation around underground telephone and electrical cables
(Henderson and Dunaway 1999).  More than 20 species of living trees
and shrubs are attacked by C. formosanus in the vicinity of New
Orleans alone, including oak, cypress, pine, and maple.  Because the
termites often hollow out and nest within trees and their base,
structural support is diminished causing many to topple during high
winds and storms.  Using techniques initially developed in the 1960s,
researches are working with pest management firms to inject infested
trees and the adjoining soil with termiticides, often with excellent
results (Henderson and Goyer 2000; Henderson 2001).</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">An
interesting sidelight is the discovery that Formosan termite nest
carton materials contains naphthalene, a common household fumigant
for fabric insect pests (Chen et al. 1998).  Naphthalene also has
antimicrobial properties, and may be acting as both an inhibitor of
harmful fungi and bacteria, and as a repellent against enemies such
as ants.  By “fumigating” their nests with naphthalene
(apparently as a defense against enemies), the Formosan termite may
also be contributing to its own demise.  Researchers have developed a
detection system to identify naphthalene within the walls of
buildings, which ultimately could become a home detection system for
termites (Henderson, 2002; personal communication).” </font>
