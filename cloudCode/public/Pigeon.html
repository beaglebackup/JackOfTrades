<p><h3>Background Information</h3>

<p><strong>Distribution &amp; Habitat</strong>  Originally found in Europe, Northern Africa and Western Asia, pigeons are now found in cities throughout the world. Pigeons are urban pests and dependent on man-made structures to build their nests and survive.<p> 

<p><strong>Identification.</strong>  Pigeons grow to be about an average of 11 inches in length and are typically grey in color with two black bands on each wing, although color may vary. They have an average wingspan of 24-28 inches. They typically weigh 8 to 13 ounces.<p> 

<p><strong>Life cycle.</strong>	 Females make nests on ledges, in crevices or in caves. They lay 2 eggs at a time that hatch out after 17-19 days. The young, called “squabs” can fly after 35 to 37 days. Females can raise several broods a year and are able to lay new eggs while previous young are still in the nest. Pigeons mate for life. They are able to live up to 15 years in the wild.<p> 
<p><strong>Feeding Behavior.</strong>  Pigeons are omnivores, feeding on seeds, grain, discarded food, insects and whatever else they can scavenge. They consume about a pound of food per week.<p> 
<p><strong>Health Concerns</strong>  Pigeons are known to carry or transmit several bird and human pathogens including pigeon ornithosis, encephalitis, Newcastle disease, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, toxoplasmosis, pseudotuberculosis, pigeon coccidiosis, and salmonella. They can also be host to lice, fleas, ticks and mites, which can feed on humans.<p>
