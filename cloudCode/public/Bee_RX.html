<p><strong>HONEY BEE SWARMS.</strong> Because honeybees are beneficial insects, they should not be indiscriminately destroyed. In the spring, swarms of bees are frequently seen on objects trees, and bushes. The swarm consists of the original queen who founded the colony and hundreds or thousands of workers. Swarmers are mild-mannered and desire only to find a place in which to relocate their nest. An exposed swarm on a shrub or tree branch may merely be resting and probably will disperse in a short time (anywhere from 30 minute to a few days when the weather is adverse). Exposed swarms should be destroyed only if: </p>

<p>1.) a local bee keeper cannot be recruited to collect them;</p>
<p>2.) the pest management professional is unwilling to relocate them alive;</p>
<p>3.) they are possibly Africanized honey bees;</p>
<p>4.) the customer is unwilling to wait for natural dispersal; or</p>
<p>5.) they are posing a health and safety risk. Full personal protective equipment should be worn when working with honey bee swarms.</p>

<p>The swarm may be taken alive by holding a cardboard box under the mass of bees while giving the limb a sharp jerk, repeating this several times to remove all the bees from the limb and deposit them into the box. One should be sure the queen does not remain on the limb. The cardboard box is then closed to prevent the bees from escaping. After removing the box to a point some distance from where the swarm originally occurred, it may then be safely opened, permitting the bees to emerge. If the bees are to be returned to a hive, the box is completely sealed and moved at night to where the hive is located, and the bees transferred to the hive on the following day. Do not attempt this technique in areas where the Africanized honey bee is potentially present.</p>

<p>A resting honey bee swarm may be destroyed by thoroughly spraying the bees with a 2% fatty acid solution (dish soap/detergent in water), or an appropriately-labeled com­mercial insecticide, can be used to drench and destroy the swarm, where permitted (Benson and Cane 1994). A large box or drop cloth placed underneath the swarm will contain the bees as they drop off so they can be removed easily.</p>


<p><strong>HONEY BEES.</strong> Honey bees pose a special problem in the walls of a building due to the presence of the honey and wax combs. The multiple layers of the hive can interfere with good distribution of insecticide, and the wax and honey can quickly bind with the insecticide rendering it inaccessible to the bees. The coating of insecticide dust on passageway sur­faces leading into the hive may also be quickly removed by the tremendous traffic of thou­sands of foraging worker bees. Treatment is similar to that described previously for yellowjackets in walls except that numerous holes should be drilled and an appropriately­ labeled aerosol insecticide used, followed by a dust insecticide application. One treatment may be sufficient to control a small colony;
however, additional insecticide treatments usually may be necessary for moderate to large colonies.</p>

<p>
Honey bee colonies, either in walls or in trees, should be treated at night. The best approach is to use modeling clay to fill in and close off the entrances to the nest and trap the bees inside. The clay should be formed around an ordinary drinking straw that will permit treatment but not allow the bees to exit. Non-residual aerosols can be excellent for treating honey bees, but aerosol treatment should be followed after a few minutes by the application of a residual dust product.</p>

<p>
Once the bees are killed, the wall in which they have been nesting should be opened and the comb and honey removed. If not, the untended honey may run down and through the walls and cause staining and sagging of the plasterboard. The dead larvae (brood) and adults will decay, creating a foul smell in the living spaces near the nest site. The odor of the honey and dead bees will attract such insects as wax moths, carpet beetles, cock­ roaches, meal moths, and various cereal beetles. Also, for years to come, other honey bee swarm scouts may home in on the smell of honey left in the structural voids and find those areas attractive for re-colonization. The customer should be advised prior to treatment that they are responsible for removing the. honey and combs, or that it will be charged as an additional service, and that the honey will not be edible.</p>

<h2>SOLITARY BEES IN STRUCTURES</h2>

<p>
The burrows of carpenter bees and leafcutting bees in wood can be treated with an appro­priately labeled insecticide dust, penetrating aerosols, or residual liquids under pressure. All entry holes should be filled with wood putty and any remaining wood surfaces that could potentially be invaded should be sprayed or painted with a repellent residual insecticide labeled for surface application outdoors. The wood may be painted or varnished as a final protective measure. Annual springtime applications of insecticide to wood trim and siding may be necessary in situations where reinfestation is likely.</p>

<p><strong>PREVENTIVE PROGRAM FOR STRUCTURES.</strong> Stinging insects use human structures to nest on because of their solidity and protective cover features. They readily nest and overwinter in structural voids because they can locate numerous structural gaps, 114-inch or larger, that lead to hundreds of comfortable, secure cavities. Also, easily excavated materials such as cedar, plasterboard, Styrofoam:&quot; and spun fiberglass are components of most structures. The best way to keep wasps from nesting on or entering structures is to anticipate the most likely areas favored by these insects and treat them using an approved residual insecticide, taking care to avoid streaking windows or staining dark woodwork and siding. Obvious gaps leading to voids can be injected with an approved insecticide dust. Exclusion/pest-proofing materials can be used to repair likely entry points.</p>
