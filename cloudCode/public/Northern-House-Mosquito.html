<h1>Northern House Mosquito</h1>
<h2>(Culex pipiens)</h2>

<p><strong>Background Information.</strong> There
are more than 3,100 species of mosquitoes worldwide, approximately
170 of those occur in the United States. While relatively few species
of mosquitoes are vectors, they are still considered one of the
primary disease threats for humans and other mammals. It is
hypothesized that mosquito borne malaria contributed to the downfall
of the Roman Empire. The connection between mosquitoes and the
diseases they spread wasn’t made until 1717 when and Italian
physician suggested that the saliva injected when they bite could
have the disease in it. 
</p>

<p><strong>Distribution &amp; Habitat.</strong> 
Culex pipens is found throughout several countries in North America,
Europe, the Middle East and Northern Africa. The Northern House
Mosquito occurs at a latitude of  39° and higher. 
</p>

<p>The
first three life stages of mosquitoes occur in water. Northern house
mosquitoes prefer fresh water with a high content of organic matter.
This species often breeds in standing water in artificial containers
like catch basins, storm drains, ditches, wastewater treatment plant
effluent, culverts, rain barrels and any other space allowed to
collect standing water.  
</p>

<p>Females
go through an overwintering period where they seek refuge in
culverts, basements or caves. 
</p>

<p><strong>Identification.</strong> House mosquitoes
are brown with white scales on their abdomen. They have no other
distinctive markings on their legs or proboscis, unlike other species
of mosquitoes. At approximately 1/4” long, they are considered
medium sized mosquitoes. 
</p>

<p><strong>Life Cycle.</strong> Any
container that can hold standing water for seven or more days has the
potential to breed mosquitoes. Females will lay 50-400 eggs, called a
raft, at a time on the top of the water. Females can lay several
rafts throughout their lifetime. These eggs hatch in 1 to 2 days,
although this is temperature dependent. Roughly the same number of
males and females are produced. Eggs require water to hatch, as do
the next two life stages. 
</p>

<p>Mosquito
larvae go through 4 larval instars, which take at least 4 days.
During the larval period, mosquitoes eat organic matter from the
surrounding water, including bacteria, algae and protozoans. After
the 4th instar, the mosquito molts into a pupa. Pupa don’t feed,
but do spend a majority of their time at the surface of the water
breathing through specialized respiratory organs. At the end of the
pupal stage, the pupal skin opens and the adult emerges. From egg to
adult takes about 8-10 days on average, but in colder temperatures it
can take several weeks. According to Loetti, V. et al. (2008), the
prime development temperatures for mosquitoes is between 50°F to
86°F. There is an inverse relationship between the temperature and
the number of days required to go from 1st instar larva to adult
emergence. At 50°, it takes an average of 39.8 days for development,
whereas it only takes 8 days at 86°. After that, developmental time
increased or remained the same. The highest percentage of mosquitoes
surviving to adulthood was at 77°F. The study found the low limit
threshold for viable development was 47° for males and 49° for
females, although it did reference other articles that cite 44° at
the lower development threshold. The upper threshold is estimated at
95°.</p>

<p>Mating
typically occurs within 28 hours of when the adults emerge from the
pupal stage. The female will feed and then take an average of 2 days
to produce eggs. Once she has laid the eggs, she will then seek
another blood meal. Females can often only need to be mated once to
produce a lifetime’s worth of eggs. The sperm is stored in a
specific organ called the spermatheca and can even preserve it while
females overwinter. Several generations of mosquitoes can be produced
in a single year. 
</p>

<p>The
lifespan of the mosquito is not well known. Most males die off a few
days after breeding. Females typically live a few months,
overwintering, or hibernating, in protected areas. 
</p>

<p>Feeding Behavior.</b> House
mosquitoes are sanguivores and feed on the blood of warm-blooded
animals, primarily birds but will feed on humans and other mammals as
necessary. They use their antennae to locate moisture, warmth and
carbon dioxide.  They will fly up to 14 miles in search of a blood
meal, although they typically don’t travel more than 1/2 mile from
the breeding sites. 
</p>

<p>When
female mosquitoes feed they insert their proboscis into their host
animal’s skin. Female mosquitoes inject foreign proteins via their
saliva, which often results in an allergic reaction that causes the
well-known itchiness and red bumps associated with mosquito bites. 
Mosquitoes eat an average of two and a half times her body weight.
Females use the proteins in egg development. Most female species need
a blood meal before they can produce their first batch of eggs. 
</p>

<p>Male
mosquitoes do not feed on blood. Their probosci are too small to
pierce an animal’s skin. Instead they feed on pollen and plant
nectar. 
</p>

<p><strong>Health Concerns.</strong>  Aside
from the itchy, annoying bites, mosquitoes are considered one of the
greatest health threats to humans because of their ability to spread
disease.  Mosquitoes are known vectors of malaria, encephalitis,
yellow fever and dengue. The primary mosquito borne health concern in
the San Francisco Bay Area is West Nile Virus. 
</p>

<p>West
Nile Virus is primarily an avian disease spread through mosquitoes
that have previously fed on an infected bird. When an infected
mosquito feeds on another animal, typically human or other mammal, it
can risk spreading the disease. The Center for Disease Control
estimates of the people who have West Nile Virus, approximately 80%
of those infected doesn’t display any symptoms. Moderate symptoms,
which accounts for about 20% of those infected, can include fever,
headache, body aches, nausea, vomiting, swollen lymph glands and skin
rash. 1 in every 150 people infected will have a severe reaction,
including: high fever, headache, neck stiffness, stupor,
disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, vision
loss, numbness and paralysis. Effects can be long term or even
permanent. Death can occur, although only one has been reported in
the San Francisco Bay Area as of 2012. People over the age of 50 are
more likely to have severe reactions. Symptoms typically occur 3 to
14 days after being bitten. There is no specific treatment of
vaccination for West Nile Virus.
