<h1>Norway Rat</h1>
<h2>(Rattus norvegicus)</h2>


<p><strong>Background Information.</strong> The
Norway rat has several common names including brown rat, gray rat,
common rat, house rat, sewer rat, wharf rat, barn rat and sewer rat.
While not originally from Norway, they were first identified there.
The species originated from Central Asia and have migrated out to
nearly anyplace worldwide where humans or human activity is found.
They made their way to the United State in the 1770’s on ships.
Rat’s teeth grow daily, up to 0.4 mm a day, and as a result they
spend up to 2% of their day gnawing on objects and can cause a
significant amount of damage as a result.  
</p>

<p><strong>Distribution &amp; Habitat.</strong> Norway
rats prefer temperate climates but have adapted to live almost
anywhere in the continental United States. They are typically found
in residences, warehouses, dock areas, garbage dumps and sewers.
While they can climb, they are not as adept as roof rats. Typically
Norway rats will nest in basements and lower parts of buildings. They
burrow in soil and are able to gnaw through wood, lead, aluminum,
copper, cinder block and unsecured concrete. Burrows are often found
at building foundations and under rubbish, woodpiles or in moist
soil. Nests are often lined with fibrous material like shredded cloth
or paper. 
</p>

<p>Norway
rats typically stay within about 65 feet of their nest while
foraging, but will travel further if resources are low.  While rats
will sometimes migrate if there is limited food resources, typically
in rural locations, but in urban populations where there is a steady
food supply Norway rats will often stay in the same location year
round. Norway rats are strong swimmers.</p>

<p>Rats
typically live in social hierarchies. When resources are low, rats
lower in the social hierarchy are excluded, and as a result die off,
first. If a large portion of rats is killed off, the remaining rats
will increase breeding to repopulate. 
</p>

<p><strong>Identification.</strong> Norway rats are
commonly completely black in color but can grey or reddish brown with
a lighter underside. They are stocky and typically range from about 7
to 10 inches in length, plus a 6 to 8 1/2 inch long tail. Average
weight ranges from about 9 oz for females and 12 oz for males,
although rats up to 30 oz have been reported. 
</p>

<p><strong>Life Cycle.</strong> Norway rats
become sexually mature at 3-5 months old and females go into heat
every 4-5 days. The gestation period is 21 days, after which females
birth typically a dozen young. Females can produce 4-7 litters per
year. The young’s eye and ears are closed until they are 12-14 days
old and become fully independent at 3-4 weeks. Adults usually live
9-12 months, although they can live up to three years. 
</p>

<p><strong>Feeding Behavior.</strong> Norway
rats are nocturnal, with most of their feeding occurring between
sunset and sunrise. Norway rats are omnivores and will feed on any
available food, including waste. They prefer meats, fish, flour,
cereal grains, fruits and vegetables. They consume about 10% of their
body weight daily. The have a strong sense of smell that allows them
to find food and can use their keen sense of taste to detect food
contaminated with levels as little as 0.5 part per million. Norway
rats are cautious of new food sources in their environment and often
exhibit what’s called “bait shyness”. 
</p>

<p>Norway
rats require daily water to survive and consume 1/2 to 1 oz of water
per day. If the rat is consuming foods with high moisture contents,
then the amount of water needed decreases. If needed Norway rats will
lick the condensation off pipes or plants. 
</p>

<p><strong>Health Concerns.</strong> Rodents
can transfer diseases bite, from vectors like fleas or mites on the
rat, or contamination from feces or urine. Rats can leave between 20
to 50 droppings per day and leave 1/2 oz urine, which can often be a
source of contamination of food and spread of disease.  Rats have
been known to be vectors either directly or through fleas, ticks or
mites on the rat for the plague, rickettsia, typhus, weil’s disease
(Leptospirosis), rat bite fever, food poisoning, hantavirus, and
trichinosis.</p>
