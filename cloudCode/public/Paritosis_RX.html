<p><strong>HISTORY OF DELUSIONS OF PARASITOSIS.</strong> Thibierge, a French dennatolo.  (1894), first described as a &quot;phobia&quot; the condition wherein people think they are b~  attacked by parasitic organisms. The condition is also known as Ekbom&#39;s syndrome cause of a paper written by a German psychiatrist K.A. Ekbom in 1938. The name &quot; Delusions of parasitosis&quot; (OOP) was given by Wilson and Miller (1964). They stated that  condition is not based on a fear or phobia but instead on the belief that parasites  attacking the body. In recent years, controversy has arisen about exactly what to call  disorder. Due to strict medical definitions of the term &quot;delusions,&quot; some researchers h  decided to call it &quot;psychogenic parasitosis,&quot; since not all patients have an unshakable belief that bugs are on them (a delusion is &quot;unshakable&quot;). However, the term DOP is still  &quot; the most prevalent and will be used here.</p>


<p>Delusions of parasitosis are not a rare occurrence. Webb (1993) stated that the Orange County Vector Control District, Garden Grove, Calif., reported an average of at least two cases of DOP each month during the past 10 years. He also reported that the number of cases has increased during the past several years, probably due to pest management professionals and health workers becoming aware that the vector control laboratory was handling DOP cases. He stated that most of the cases handled by his laboratory were a, post-menopausal women who had undergone a life-altering event such as the loss loved one through divorce or death. Trabert (1995) analyzed 1,223 cases of delusion parasitosis. He found that DOP may occur in every period of life but are most prevalent older subjects and more common in women than men. He also stated that the treatment DOP is now, with the use of psychopharmacological drugs, very favorable; the rate of remissions is about 51.9%.</p>


<p>Many people suffering from delusions of parasitosis seek help from pest management professionals and from entomologists. Pest management professionals are totally unable teal with the psychological aspects of the problem. Entomologists, once they have ruled out the existence of a &quot;real&quot; pest animal, have the problem of where to refer their clients. Many physicians are not really &quot;sympathetic&quot; to the patient&#39;s problem, particularly; when it becomes clear that the patient is &quot;imagining&quot; a parasite. Often, a physician can complicate the problem, telling the patient that he has been bitten by some insect, spider, or mite. This only serves to strengthen the patients&#39; belief that he is being attacked creatures.</p>


<p>Kushon (1993) stated that entomologists may see cases of OOP before physicians become involved. He said that of the 156 cases he studied, 71% of these were referred to physicians by entomologists. Of these, 58% were referred to dermatologists, 22% to allergists, 17% to general practitioners, and 3% to psychiatrists.</p>
<p>The reason for the low referral rate to psychiatrists is understandable. A natural resistance on the part of the entomologist to suggest that his client see a psychiatrist is apparent. The client &quot;knows&quot; that his problem is real and any referral to a psychiatrist means this problem is being perceived as a mental condition. In addition, there are legal problems with suggesting that a person see a psychiatrist. The person may become of­ fed and file a lawsuit, claiming that the entomologist &quot;made a medical diagnosis.&quot; he following is taken from a paper written by J.H. Poorbaugh (1993) as to the role of entomologist where DOP are concerned: &quot;In my experience, a confident opinion by entomologist is very important. It only serves to deepen the suspicion of the affected ron when the entomologist says something to the effect that, &#39;I didn&#39;t find anything. I don’t think an arthropod is involved, but, just in case, I want you to take this sticky tape adhesive sample bottles and if you do find something, you can then bring it to me.&#39; Such see only serves to exacerbate the problem, not lead to a solution.&quot; Poorbaugh suggested the entomologist use the following approach: &quot;It is my opinion that an insect or r js not responsible for your problem, but this happens to people. It seems very real to you that it&#39;s a mite or parasite of some kind, but our skin and bodies can fool us. I suggest you see a family doctor and if he or she does find something unusual, they can submit it to me. Please let me know when you get the appointment and who it is with, and I will fumish your doctor with information.&quot; Poorbaugh then suggested contacting the physician, providing information about delusions of parasitosis, and explaining that a arthropod has not been found to be involved.</p>


<p>Probably the best medical specialist to refer a person with skin rashes or suspect &quot;bites&quot; is to a dermatologist. Once a medical cause has been ruled out, the dermatologist may recognize the person as requiring psychiatric help and refer them to a psychiatrist.</p>


<p>The preceding advice is excellent; however. it is important to note that a real arthropod may be present but undetected. The author has had two instances where after a yea looking at all sorts of samples, a soft tick and a bird mite were discovered. Hedges(lS encountered a woman who, the longer she recounted her story, the more bizarre it came - a typical sign of DOP. especially since other family members were not reporting similar &quot;attacks.&quot; She provided a vial of alcohol, however, that under microscopic evaluation contained mites that were later determined to be predators of insect eggs. 11 mites were not biting the woman, but when she saw them crawling on the bathroom floor she likely began her DOP episode.</p>

<p>In a case reported by Hampel et al. (1995), a woman developed painful swelling muscle weakness, and eventually depression following a trip to Europe. Doctors were unable to find the cause of her symptoms and discounted her contention that &quot;worm organisms had penetrated her skin.&quot; Four months after her symptoms began, however the woman began to show the first signs of subcutaneous myiasis. In all, the woman 1 l, 1.5- x 1.5-inch nodules appear under the skin of her neck, left shoulder, and arm. managed to aspirate part of a fly larva from one nodule that was identified as the stage larva of Hypoderma linea tum, a bot fly. Remember, strange events do occur, so lesson for both pest management professionals and doctors is that full investigations warranted to rule out arthropod involvement.</p>



<p><strong>ORIGIN OF A &quot;PEST&quot; PROBLEM.</strong> It is also interesting that people suffering from [­ often know exactly when and why the problem first started. For example, they may cl it all started when:
<ul>

	<li>1.) A new rug was brought into the house.</li> 

	<li>2.) A new bed or mattress was purchased.</li>

<li>3.) The air conditioner was first turned on in the spring and a cloud of dust (or mites) shot into the room.</li>


	<li>4.) A &quot;not-so-clean&quot; guest stayed overnight.</li> 
	<li>5.) The toilet ovetflowed.</li>
	<li>6.) The roof leaked.</li>
	<li>7.) The family returned from camping.</li>
	<li>8.) Various collectibles were brought into the house.</li> 
	<li>9.) Someone deliberately brought the pests in.</li>
	<li>10.) The family picked up the pests from a dirty motel.</li>
</ul>
</p>



<p><strong>EFFECTS OF DOP.</strong> People suffering from delusions of parasitosis lead very stress lives. They constantly are preoccupied with their problem and may take unusual and harsh actions to be rid of it. They may try and cut out the &quot;mite&quot; living under their skin. en (1997) knew of a man who cut into his nipple to remove a mite he was certain lived ne. People have told the author about taking baths in caustic materials and pesticides to kill offending organisms. Some patients have burned their furniture.</p>


<p>Kloblenzer (1993) cited the following example of what a woman suffering from DOPIi.) be rid of her &quot;parasites.&quot; She burned all her clothing including a mink coat, threw der upholstered furniture, and lived in a single room with a single wooden chair, table, cot that she felt were uninfested. She kept only two sets of clothing - one she wore dthe other she kept in a plastic bag until needed. She stopped driving because she believed that she became infested with mites that blew onto her from her car&#39;s air conditioner. Another patient of Dr. Koblenzer scrubbed their skin daily with bleach and steel &#39;() for many months. Another frequently applied gasoline to get the &quot;pests&quot; off. </p>

<p>Berenbaurn (1995) cited the following from Luis Bunuel&#39;s 1982 autobiography of a visit to the hotel room of Salvador Dali in Montmarte: &quot;I found him stripped to the waist, esormous bandage on his back. Apparently he thought he&#39;d felt a &#39;flea&#39; or some other strange beast and had attacked his back with a razor blade. Bleeding profusely, he got the r-l manager to call a doctor, only to discover that the &#39;flea&#39; was in reality a pimple.&quot; :he patient of Dr. Koblenzer (1993) thought that the &quot;worms&quot; living around her eyes would travel to her mouth while she was eating to compete for her food. &quot;Apparently, they were very finicky eaters and would move around violently if they did not like what suffered them; her diet was govemed by the need not to displease them, and she was as thin as a skeleton.&quot;<p>

<p>While most people affected with delusions of parasitosis are often able to live with rrproblem by incorporating it into their lives, Monk (1994) reported a suicide of a 40-veld man suffering from DOP. The following is a list of possible causes and precipi­ ~g factors of DOP:</p>

<p><h6>Stress.</h6> A case of delusions of parasitosis described by Oruc and Bell (1995) was believed to have resulted from multiple rape traumas. In other cases, the author has found upon questioning clients that most of them have been under considerable stress prior to their DOP condition. Stress caused by situations, such as a recent death in the family, personal conflicts, divorce, loneliness, and crowded or cluttered working conditions can result in symptoms that include itching and skin irritations (Keh 1983). Reducing the stress level at work can prompt a cure. In an office situation with &quot;mystery bugs,&quot; the &quot;bugs&quot; went away after a fun Labor Day weekend of picnicking and partying (Blum 1986).</p>

<p><h6>Conflict.</h6> Conflict may exist between workers and management. According to Benjamin K &quot;worker or tenant dissatisfaction is unconsciously transmuted from an unresolved grievance to a concrete complaint for which health authorities are expected to produce a finding of deficiencies on the part of either management or the landlord&quot; (Keh 1983) .</p>

<p><h6>Anxiety.</h6> People may suffer anxiety attacks due to personal pressures. The reasons for these attacks may not be known, but if the problem can be identified, solutions can be initiated and the problem resolved. If problems cannot correctly be identified, and &quot;solutions&quot; are not working because the problem is multifaceted and some of the causes not tangible, pest management professionals may become involved with a more serious case than intended (Katz 1982). Sometimes a person who has had a real flea, mite louse problem may anxiously believe that these pests are still present even though pests have been successfully controlled.</p>

<p><h6>Monosymptomatic Hypochondriacal Psychosis. </h6>This condition is a false belief cannot be corrected by reason (Gonzalez et al. 1993). In the cases of delusions of &quot;but the victim of the &quot;bites&quot; will collect anything as specimens, including dust and lint. fected persons will complain of being bitten very frequently or constantly. Another maninfestation is the feeling of small parasites that creep into the skin. crawl around, and multiply. Affected people may feel unbearable itching, and the effects of scratching will be seen on the skin. In addition, a change of environment may not stop the &quot;biting&quot; (I 1983; Schal 1986).</p>


<p><h6>Psychodermatological Syndromes.</h6> These syndromes will produce severe itching symptoms. Psychogenic pruritus is caused by emotional tension, such as an emotional corn situation and/or because of a disturbed personality structure. The emotions of repressed anger and repressed anxiety most often lead to an itching fit and the person may begin scratch vehemently.<p>




<p><h6>Paranoid Dementia.</h6> Dementia can be characterized by a loss of/or impairment  of one’s intellect, will, memory, or reason (Mitchell and Vierkant 1991: St. Aubin 1982). If dementia is called &quot;precox&quot; it means that onset of the problem is early in a person’s development, usually during adolescence. Two types of dementia can occur: the paranoid and the schizophrenic. While these illnesses rarely manifest themselves as delusion parasitosis, some incidences of this have occurred, particularly with the schizophrenic type. In such cases, there may be considerable danger involved. Untreated paranoid schizophrenics may think the whole world is &quot;out to get them&quot; and lash out violently.</p>

<p><h6>Involutionary Melancholia.</h6> This condition is induced by female menopause or n &quot;change of life&quot; and may initiate delusionary parasitosis (St. Aubin 1982).</p>

<p><h6>Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs).</h6> With the advent of the computerized office, pest management professionals are receiving more calls about mystery bugs from offices in with many of the personnel uses CRTs. For some undetermined reason, these calls are commonplace (Blum 1986).</p>

<p><h6>Entomophobia.</h6> Entomophobia (or fear of insects) is rarely a cause of DOP, but related. Entomophobia is an inordinate fear of bugs often founded on unpleasant past experiences with insects or arthropods. For example, a child is stung by a wasp and remembers the pain associated with this event. Later in life, he has a conscious (or unconscious) fear that many insects are harmful and thus is extremely afraid of them. Another example might be a three-year-old child sitting on the grass and finding a caterpillar. He is about to put this into his mouth when his mother, seeing this, screams and quickly snatches the insect away. While the insect was not frightening, the mother&#39;s response &#39;Later, this fear manifests itself as a general fear of insects. Often, one&#39;s fear of insects may come from parental fear of insects. The parent is afraid; therefore, the child has a fear of insects. This fear is unfounded, but it is a fear nonetheless. entomophobia actually goes beyond normal or even strong fears. This condition in­ ~s a morbid fear of insects, resulting in an acute psychological phobia about insects causes a high degree of anxiety. Katz (1982) defined phobias as simply unusually intense fears. Marks (1978) defined &quot;phobia&quot; as a special kind of fear that is out of pro­ [on to the demands of the situation, cannot be explained or reasoned away, is beyond &#39;uary control, and leads to avoidance of the feared situation.</p>


<p>Usually entomophobia is relatively easy to treat - the person knows he is afraid of its even though he may not know why he is afraid. People who know they have a phobia may seek the help of a psychiatrist. Freudian psychoanalytic therapy attempts to t; the repressed, underlying causes to the surface. Behavioral therapy is based on the 1:[ that phobias are a learned condition and can be unlearned (Hardy 1988).</p>


<p>When dealing with a person with a phobia, normally helpful advice will not work. ~rding to Jerilyn Ross, of the Phobia Society of America, you should &quot;be sensitive to that and don&#39;t make fun of them. The worst thing you can say to somebody is, &#39;Don&#39;t~&#39;i about it. It won&#39;t hurt you.&quot;</p>



<p><h6>Bell’s Syndrome.</h6>One person will feel an itch and scratch vigorously, and the power of Suggestion starts a chain reaction of &quot;itches and bites&quot; among co-workers. As the name implies, this situation was originally observed in the large rooms where batteries of telephone operators handled phone calls (Katz 1982). This is a similar reaction to the &quot;yawn&quot; syndrome. One person yawns, then everyone around does the same.</p>

<p><h2>PROBLEMS OF AN ORGANIC NATURE CAUSING A “CRAWLING” SENSATION ON SKIN</h2>

<p><h6>Prescription Drugs.</h6> Of all the prescription drugs in common use, about half often cause skin eruptions, and these eruptions may mimic many types of skin disease (Parker 1983). Some of the new potent medicines cause development of simple urticaria, i.e. raised itching patches on the surface of the skin. Other symptoms may include: generalized rough, red papular rash over widespread areas of the body, sometimes with a tight feeling I)~ skin, scaling, itching, or a combination of these (Nourse 1973). Drug photosensitivity is an adverse cutaneous response resulting from interaction of light with drugs pint in skin at the time of irradiation (Harber 1983).</p>

<p><h6>Sensitivity to Medicines.</h6> Many elderly people (the group most frequently encountered Suffering from DOP) lake numerous medications, many of them being over-the-counter items. Stem (1990) wrote that elderly people frequently take too many medicines c taking too high a dose. She quoted Dr. Jerry Avorn, Harvard Medical School associate professor of social medicine, as saying: &quot;Drugs can have dangerous side effects for Sons of any age, but the elderly are particularly at risk. The efficiency of the kidney liver can decline with age, hampering ability to excrete drugs, which in turn can le, drug buildup in the body. Many medicines are stored in body fat, so the gradual increase in proportion of fat to muscle as one ages also can lead to higher drug concentrations result: A drug dosage that was safe and effective at age 50 can be dangerous at age 70. What’s more, many bodily organs, from the heart to the bladder to the brain, can undergo changes in their sensitivity to medication.&quot;</p>




<p><h6>Drug or Medicinal Interactions.</h6> Even commonly taken medicines such as antibi, cold remedies, aspirin, etc. may, if taken in combination, cause side effects that art known to physicians and pharmaceutical companies. DOP could be one of these effects.</p>

<p><h6>Drug Abuse. <h6>Drugs such as cocaine, heroin, PCP, amphetamines, etc. (Grinspoon Bakalar 1985; Epem 1988; Howell 1961; Mitchell andVierkant 1991) are well knov cause delusions of parasitosis, even after many years of disuse. On occasion, comp ants describe a feeling of &quot;bugs&quot; moving under their skin. This condition is termed&#39; mication.&quot;</p>

<p><h6>Fungal infections</h6> such as athlete&#39;s foot or ringworm can occur on various parts of the body.</p>

<p><h6>Liver disease, renal disease, diabetes, thyroid disorders, and some maliginant disorders<h6> and some <h6>malignant disorders</h6>may cause itching. (Katz 1982).</p>

<p><h6>Chicken pox.</h6> Itching that may persist even after the disease has run its course. This itching may subsequently be attributed to an arthropod infestation.</p>

<p><h6>Herpes zoster</h6> or &quot;shingles&quot; is a viral neurological disorder that makes itself know an eruption of painful blisters on the skin, often on the chest, neck, back, or thigh, usually on one side (Katz 1982).</p>

<p><h6>Gender</h6> is a factor in the susceptibility to develop dermatitis. Women&#39;s skin is less oily than men&#39;s, thus making it more sensitive to irritants, especially solvents (Anonynous 1981).<p>

<p><h6>Pregnancy.</h6> Itching is a fairly common manifestation in the last trimester of pregnancy (Katz 1982). With the onset of pregnancy and associated hormonal changes, this sh. not be surprising.</p>

<p><strong>DETERMINING WHETHER AN ARTHROPOD IS ACTUALLY INVOLVED.</strong> Determination of arthropod involvement is difficult since a pest may be present, but temporarily undetected.</p>

<p><strong>AVOID TREATMENTS FOR PEST INFESTATIONS THAT DO NOT EXIST.</strong> Unless an I arthropod can be confirmed to be causing the person&#39;s condition, treatments should aided. If a pest management professional does treat for &quot;imaginary&quot; pests, he or she d consider the following factors.

<p>1.) It may be unethical.</p>


<p>2.) It may essentially be a violation of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FlFRA), as well as the pest control act of each state. No pesticide is presently registered for use against a nonexistent pest. The target pest must be known in order to treat.</p>


<p>3.)Psychological problems will deepen. [f your client is suffering from delusions of parasitosis, a pest control treatment will not help the situation. Temporary r(&#39; may be provided by treating, but the &quot;pests&quot; will certainly come back.


<p>4.) You will be driven crazy because clients will keep calling with reports that the p have returned. Constant retreatments will be requested and the time between references of the pest will shorten.</p>

<p>5.) You will eventually give up and walk away, and/or refund any money paid, and will probably be very unhappy about it.</p>

<p>6.) You maybe sued. Frequently, clients sue pest management professionals, not for failing to achieve control of the pest, but for their chemical poisoning. They forget about original &quot;pest&quot; and then claim that the pesticides you used affected their health.</p>

<p>St. Aubin (1982) presented an excellent discussion of not treating for an imaginary pest: &quot;Do not offer to continue treatment or be coaxed by the patient into treatment; pallative. Although it is unlikely, it is nonetheless conceivable that you could be asked the psychiatrist or physician to treat the premises, or to continue treatment. Even though it maybe their professional opinion that such acts would have a therapeutic effect upon their (your) patient, you must firmly point out that it is a violation of FIFRA, as amended to apply pesticides for pests which are not present. Sugar pills may be a desirable placebo and perhaps may be an ethical treatment in medicine, but unwarranted pesticide application is illegal!&quot;</p>



<h2>TIPS FOR DETERMINING IMAGINARY &quot;BUG BITES&quot;</h2>


<p>1.) The bugs or worms are coming out of the client&#39;s teeth or skin pores.</p>

<p>2.)The pests float in the air or rise up as a cloud from a piece of furniture.</p>




<p>3.) They turn into powder. self destruct, or dissolve. </p>

<p>4.) They are attacking and making holes in cooking pots, porcelain. or in Formica counters.</p>

<p>5.) They are coming out of household items such as toothpaste, Vaseline, cosmetics, etc.</p>

<p>6.) The pests are too small to see or collect, but they can fly or jump.</p>

<p>7.) They make clicking noises, they chirp.</p>

<p>8.) They change their coloration.</p>

<p>9.) They suck the blood on your head.</p>

<p>10.) They come out only at night.</p>

<p>11.) The pests are highly transmissible. Friends and relatives end up getting them from the infected person (Berenbaum 1995, citing Waldron 1961).</p>

<p>12.) The infestations last for a long time - months and even years. Most arthropod infestations do not remain around indefinitely (Berenbaum 1995, citing Waldron 1961).</p>

<p>13.) The &quot;bugs&quot; are often found in the hair and seen on the comb or can be shaken out onto a sheet (Berenbaum 1995, citing Waldron 1961).</p>

<p><h2>HANDLING A &quot;BITING&quot; PEST PROBLEM</h2>

<p>A real pest may not exist, and a case of delusions of parasitosis may be the problem. Of course, the pest management professional should do everything possible to de mine if a real pest is present. Just because the client is describing weird things about the offending pest does not mean that it may not exist. The client is not an entomologist or a pest management professional, and he/she may not understand insect or mite biology and behavior.</p>

<p>I.) Inspect the premises carefully for all pests.</p>


<p>2.) Identify any insects or other arthropods found. </p>

<p>3.) Ask questions such as:</p>
<ul>

	<li>Exactly what is the problem?</li>

	<li>Where is the problem occurring? In all rooms? Or, just one?</li>

	<li>At what time of day does biting occur?</li>

	<li>Can any thing be seen?</li>

	<li>Are any others in the household or business establishment being bitten?</li>

	<li>Do you have any pets at home?</li>

	<li>Do you hear any noises in the attic or walls? There may be rodents or birds nesting in the walls and these may be carrying mites on them.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><h6>Things a pest management professional should NOT do:</h6>
<p>1.) Do not treat without first having identified a pest.</p>
<p>2.)Do not examine the client&#39;s body (they may ask you to do this). Do not tell the client they are crazy or imagining things.</p>
<p>3.)Do not diagnose your client&#39;s problem if you think they are imagining things. You are not a dermatologist or a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>4.)Do not get personal with your client.</p>


<p><h6>Guidelines as to what CAN be done:</h6>
<p>1.)Explain to the client that treatment for any pest should not be applied unless it has been identified.</p>

<p>2.) If the client insists on a pesticide treatment, explain to him or her that state and federal regulatory agencies prohibit use of a pesticide unless a target pest is known.</p> 

<p>3.) Use the analogy that a physician could not treat a disease unless that disease has been diagnosed. Likewise, a pest cannot possibly be successfully controlled unless its identity is known.</p>

<p>4.) Explain that every step will be taken to determine if arthropods are present. Sticky traps should be placed in all areas of reported &quot;activity.&quot; Any pest seen or provided to the professional by the client will be examined. When necessary, specimens may be sent to an entomologist for identification. An agreement to examine any samples the client provides will result in looking at some very weird stuff. The following items are examples:<P>
<ul>
<li> a. Scabs picked from the body (very commonly submitted).</li>

<li> b. Clothing with holes in the fabric. What caused it? In addition, white things on dark fabrics and black things on light fabrics.</li>

<li>c. Vacuum cleaner debris. A completely filled vacuum bag is almost impossible to sift through.</li>


<li>d. Nose pickings or tissue paper full of mucous.</li>

<li>e. Toilet paper - patients may complain of anal itch.</li>

<li>f. Pubic hairs.</li>

<li>g. Urine.</li>

</ul></p>

<p>5.) If no pest is discovered, you are not responsible for the problem. At this point, (if it hasn&#39;t been done already), refer the client to an entomologist. Eventually, the client should be referred (but not by you) to a physician and specifically to a psychiatrist who is familiar with DOP.</p>

<p>Kushon (1993) is such a psychiatrist in Philadelphia who is very qualified to handle [patients. He operates a Parasitosis Clinic at Hahnemann University Hospital in Fylvania. His approach is multidisciplinary. Patients are seen by Dr. Kushon (psychiatrist), an entomologist, and a dermatologist.</p>


<p>Some danger, other than lawsuits, may also exist to the pest management professional a the entomologist as well. There have been reports of DOP patients attempting to their general practitioner.</p>


<p>Remember, true delusions of parasitosis are a psychological problem. It is very complex nature and the pest management professional has no business trying to solve it. Cs should be referred to a physician knowledgeable about this condition.</p>
