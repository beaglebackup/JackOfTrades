<h1>Velvety
Tree Ant</h1>
<h2>Liometopum
occidentale</h2>
<h2>Subfamily
Dolichodorinae</h2>

<p><strong>Identifying Characteristics.</strong> 
“Workers range in size from 2.5 to 5.5 mm long.  They have a
one-segmented petiole, and the abdomen is covered with very fine
hairs, which gives them a velvety appearance.   Although they may
superficially resemble carpenter ants, they belong to a difference
subfamily.</p>

<p><strong>Distribution.</strong>
 Velvety tree ants are found in the western and southwestern states
from Colorado through Arizona, California and the Pacific Northwest. 
Liometopum occidentale is distributed along the West Coast from
Oregon to Baja California, from sea level to 4800 feet (Snelling and
George 1979).  The closely related L. luctuosum ranges from Wyoming
to western Texas, Nevada, and California, and into Mexico (Gulmahamad
1995).  Regional common names for this species include black velvety,
pine tree an, and silky carpenter ant.</p>

<p><strong>Biology &amp; Habits.</strong>  In
their natural habitat, nests of velvety tree ants are typically under
stones or in hollow trees.  Infestations resemble those of carpenter
ants, but the excavated materials has a finer texture.  To build the
nest chambers, which are composed of paper-like material called
carton, the ants mix pieces of plant material and soil and add a
secretion that cements it together.  Brood chambers are maintained
within this matrix.  The ants often congregate in hollows within the
insulation or wood, forming temporary “resting places” or
bivouacs for the foragers.  Damage to insulation can be severe, but
damage to wood has not been documented.  Attempts to located nests
indoors are often unsuccessful because the “nests” are the
temporary bivouacs, which are vacated or moved as foraging
territories change.</p>

<p>Velvety
tree ants are aggressive and will attack and spray intruders with
secretions that resemble those of odorous house ants.  Homeowners
often complain about strong odors associated with an infestation of
velvety tree ants.</p>

<p>Trails
of large colonies can be 2 to 3 cm wide but are often hidden from
view.  Velvety tree ants tend homopterans for honeydew, prey on other
arthropods, and also scavenge on dead animals.”</p>
