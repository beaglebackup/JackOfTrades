<h2>INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM] FOR FABRIC PEST INFESTATIONS</h2>


<p>
"The role of the pest management professional has changed over the years in the prevention and treatment of fabric pest infestations. Many of the insecticides used in the past  have been taken off the market for a variety of reasons. The products still available today  may have label restrictions that could limit their use. Today, pest management professionals must utilize their knowledge of the target pest, inspection, sanitation recommendations, storage recommendations, quarantine recommendations, and non-pesticide techniques as well as pesticide tools. This integrated approach will result in safe, long-term control. Since a homeowner&#39;s personal possessions or even a priceless museum artifacts may be infested, great care must be taken when eliminating a fabric pest infestation.</p>

<p>
Despite the lack of permanent moth-proofmg alternatives, the following are possible reasons that fabric pests have not become major pests in the United States:</p>

<ul><li>
Synthetic fibers have replaced much of the wool formerly used in clothing and home  furnishings. According to the Carpet and Rug Institute (2002), 97% of carpet made today is from synthetic fibers. A stylish trend from heavy woolen apparel to Polartec-&quot;  type synthetic garments has, to some extent, foiled the pests that used to feed on woolens stored during the summer months.</li>
<li>
Air conditioning, central heating, and insulation have changed temperature and humidity conditions within the home. Lower humidity is not favorable to fabric pest survival.</li>
<li>
Flooring such as plywood subfloor and tightly fitted squares of tile, linoleum, or similar materials that do not have the crevices of hardwood flooring are unfavorable fabric pest infestations.</li>
<li>
It is believed that the newer vacuum cleaners are more efficient than some of the earlier models and perform better in removing fabric pest larvae, eggs, and keratinous particles (Rust 1997).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Although fabric pests may be less common than they were in homes, they still are  serious problem in museums and some commercial establishments and must be controlled. By no means are fabric pests in danger of becoming extinct. Suggestions that fabric pests would increase in importance, due to the lack of permanent moth-proofers, owner, have not been realized.</p>


<p><strong>INSPECTION.</strong> The first step in the control of fabric pests is to inspect the premises for the source of infestation. Animal products of all kinds are attacked as are grain-based products on occasion. An important consideration during inspections is that the newly hatched larvae are so tiny that they can crawl into almost any crack or crevice. Thus, once the female has deposited her eggs on the cover of woolen upholstered furniture or in the crevices or seams, the larvae can readily enter the furniture&#39;s interior. Moreover, the fe­male may creep inside the furniture through any opening she can find, Rugs and the mats beneath rugs, upholstered furniture stuffed with animal hair, trunks packed with woolens, mounted animal specimens, piano felts, fly-tying kits, accumulations of lint and pet hair in floor cracks and ducts, furs, feathers, animal nests, and carcasses all may harbor fabric pests. Dark storage rooms, lint-laden corners, attics, basements, areas under slip covers and furniture, back sides of furniture. and seldom-used sofas in darkened corners all need to be inspected. Generally speaking, items left undisturbed for long periods of time are primary inspection targets. The list of objects that could potentially be attacked by fabric pests is a long list indeed. Proper identification of the species involved will help to focus the inspection efforts by identifying the food preferences of that particular species.</p>

<p>
One should very carefully ascertain whether insulating or soundproofing materials of plant or animal origin have been used in the construction of the building. At one time, horse hair insulation was quite common. Jennings (1940) noted that where hair-felt insu­lation in a building is infested by carpet beetles, control can be realized only by removing the insulation from the building. However, with the advent of pheromone traps for sev­eral fabric pests, there are now other alternatives that may, at least, reduce the problem.Turner (1940) reported finding Dermestes spp. in insulating board, with most of the larvae coming from the fireplace. Investigation revealed the presence of a dead squirrel In a shelf above the damper.</p>

<p>
An infestation of black carpet beetles in a home may furnish a clue to related problems elsewhere. After numerous black carpet beetle adults were found around the windows of the home, it was some time before the source was discovered in a blocked-off fireplace. Several dead birds, heavily infested with larvae. were found in the flue when the fireplace vas opened for inspection. Pieces of toast, suet, and cherry seeds were also present, apparently having been dropped in the flue by the birds. It appeared as though the birds became trapped in the flue, died, and became a haven for carpet beetles.</p>

<p>
Zappe (1945) recorded an occasion where insects were falling on employees operat­ing sewing machines ill a shirt factory. Investigation revealed that the previous tenant made woolen garments and large amounts of lint had been left in the building. The lint was breeding larvae of black carpet beetles.</p>

<p>
Hinton (1943, 1945) and Linsley (1946) studied the natural resting places of carpet beetles, such as the nests of birds, rodents, insects, and spiders, as sources of infestation in the home.</p>

<p>
Questions must be asked of the building&#39;s occupants to determine where potential breeding sites may be located. Determine if a rodent problem has been present in the past. Not only will dead mice and rats harbor a fabric pest infestation, but beetles will also infest the forgotten rodent bait put out to control the problem. Ask about any bird nest: insect nests, squirrel nests, or cluster fly infestations that may have occurred over the past few years. Sticky traps are good tools for monitoring the premises for fabric pests, an pheromone traps are available for clothes moths and some fabric pest beetles.</p>

<p>
An inspection technique using a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy system (FTIR) was investigated by Koestler et al. (2000). This device is capable of detecting carbon dioxide emissions from museum objects, i.e. insect respiration. Although not without it disadvantages, the system was able to detect several species of pests.</p>


<p><strong>MECHANICAL CONTROL AND EXCLUSION.</strong> The future of controlling fabric pests as well as other pests, will involve the integrated use of all tools available. There are time when an insecticide may not be suitable or it can only be used in certain circumstances Since many fabric beetles come from outdoors, recommendations to the occupants of the building can be made to exclude these pests. Pinniger (1994) recommends in the case of museums, to keep doors and windows fitted with tight-fitting weather stripping. Windows should not be open unless they have fine mesh screens. Flowering plants and shrub: must be kept well away from the building and potted plants, cut flowers and firewood should be prohibited from storage and working areas.</p>

<p><h6>Infested items.</h6> Once the infestation has been discovered, the type of mechanical treatment to be employed will vary. Where possible, remove and discard the infested item This may not be possible if it is a cherished object of the homeowner or an item of monetary or historic value. In these cases, the object must be treated in such a way to mitigate the infestation as described below.</p>


<p><h6>Vacuum devices.</h6> Vacuum cleaners are becoming increasingly important insect management tools. They can be used to remove lint accumulations as well as the remnants of old bird and insect nests. Be certain to use a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter system to prevent the aerosolization of pest body fragments and other dust that may result in an allergic reaction in some sensitive individuals.</p>

<p>Vacuuming is extremely important to remove available food sources used by fabric pests. Hair, dead insects, and food crumbs can accumulate along and under baseboards behind and under furniture, under the cushions of furniture, and inside dressers, drawers, and chests. The customer should be instructed to vacuum all such areas prior to any pest control treatments. Rugs and wall hangings should be thoroughly vacuumed on both sides and, if heavily infested, discarded or cleaned according to manufacturer&#39;s recom­mendations.</p>

<p>The use of an industrial vacuum cleaner on clothes and rugs will pick up eggs, larvae. and pupae of clothes moths. Dr. Michael Rust, University of California, Riverside, tested the Lil&#39; Hummer, a high-power backpack vacuum cleaner, and found it pulled out all stages of the clothes moth, especially the pupae attached to fibers in the rug.</p>


<p><h6>Dry cleaning.</h6> DIY cleaning effectively kills all stages off fabric pests. Homeowners should be asked to dry clean woolen clothing and other susceptible garments according to the clothing manufacturer&#39;s instructions at the same time the home is treated for fabric pests. Woolen (oriental) rugs, tapestries, etc. can be professionally cleaned.</p>


<p><h6>Brushing.</h6> The &quot;good old&quot; method of removing woolens and like materials and brushing id beating them at intervals of once or twice a month is a very effective technique to protect susceptible items. Clothing and blankets that remain in constant use are rarely damaged by clothes moths. By beating and brushing clothes, the eggs and possibly even the younger larvae are crushed or dislodged.</p>


<p><h6>Trapping.</h6> Wilson (1940) found clothes moths and carpet beetles are attracted into box aps containing cloth pads treated with fish meal or an alcoholic extract of fish meal. He also found glue traps treated with various animal substances were useful in trapping clothes moths. Non-baited adhesive traps can also be helpful in monitoring for fabric pests that roam from the larval feeding site, and around windows to monitor for flying adults. Effective pheromones have been developed for the webbing clothes moth, casemaking clothes moth, Trogoderma spp., varied carpet beetle, and black carpet beetle. These can be very useful in monitoring for infestations of fabric pests.</p>


<p><h6>Cedar products.</h6>The homeowner has long attributed special &quot;mystical powers&quot; to cedar oil, cedar wood, cedar chips, and even cedar deodorants with respect to their supposed ability to drive away fabric pests. The heartwood of red cedar (Juniperus virginiana L.) contains from 2% to 4% of a volatile oil. As a rule, red cedm&#39; closets constructed of full­ length boards or chip board are not sufficiently tight or kept closed long enough to retain the volatile oil, and thus are of little use in controlling fabric pests. Since chests are lighter, they are usually slightly more effective in this respect. It should be noted that the volatile oil of cedar is not a repellent. Only freshly cut cedar wood of the proper species and thickness will kill fabric pests, and even then only in an air-tight chamber (Katz 1981). Laudani and Clark (1954) and Laudani (l957) showed that after cedar chests are 36 months old, they are practically useless in killing fabric insects with the volatile essen­tial oils then being absent.</p>


<p><strong>NON-PESTICIDAL TECHNIQUES.</strong> The decline in available pesticides, along with the risk associated with treating valuable museum objects with pesticides, has spurred inter­est in alternative methods of fabric pest management.</p>

<p><h6>Oxygen removal.</h6> Although not a &quot;pesticidal&quot; technique, oxygen removal should only be employed by trained individuals. A lack of oxygen can kill humans as well as pests. Because of potential problems with damage to artifacts by conventional fumigants, oxy­gen deprivation alternatives have been developed. A novel approach, perfected by Dr. Mike Rust of the University of California, Riverside, and Shin Maekawa of the Getty Conservation Institute, involves killing the insects by oxygen deprivation in a closed container. Drlik (199S) describes this method as working for both small and large items and for many insects and insect life stages. A bag large enough to hold the infested site is constructed from an oxygen-impermeable film by heat-sealing strips of film together For small items such as books, preliminary purging of atmospheric oxygen with nitrogen gas is not necessary, and the oxygen scavenger AgeLess™ (a finely powdered iron oxide can be used to reduce the oxygen content to O. 1 % inside the bag. Eight days in an oxygen deficient atmosphere will kill most insects. If an infestation of cigarette beetles or wood boring beetles is suspected, the bag must be left undisturbed for at least 16 days. The higher the temperature and the lower the humidity, the less time is needed for treatment Because the relative humidity of nitrogen is so low, it is necessary to regulate the humidity inside the bag in order to avoid damaging the infested article (Tucker 1995; Ka 1995a).</p>

<p>DeCesare (1990) of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California Davis, has found that the inert gas argon is very effective at killing all stages of any insect in books and library materials. &quot;In this process, books are placed in an air-tight container such as a 33-gallon plastic trash can, which is then flushed and filled with argon. Being heavier than air, it is quite easy to force all the air out of the container within 10 minutes and insure that the atmosphere inside the trash can is solely argon. The Lid, which has been securely taped onto the trash can, may be provided with a hole to test for the adequacy of the flushing. By simply holding a match over the hole, if it is extinguished, no air remains within:&#39; Currently, DeCesare leaves the items within the argon treatment chamber for a period of two weeks. All stages of insects and their eggs are eventual suffocated by the lack of oxygen in the argon-rich atmosphere. Argon is inexpensive non-reactive with museum materials or the environment, and will actually stop any decomposition of paper due to reactions with chemicals in the paper that are catalyzed by air oxidation. It is also a renewable resource, unlike helium.</p>

<p>
Another oxygen-deprivation technique is the use of carbon dioxide. Since carbon dioxide is a bit more difficult to handle than argon, problems associated with frost formation as it changes from a liquid in a cylinder to a gaseous form must be overcome museum materials and artifacts are to be fumigated. Most consider these problems minor and find carbon dioxide to be an effective fumigant if concentrations can be held high enough over a long enough period of time. When fumigating with this material, a 60 concentration for a period of 10 days is required to kill all life stages of most insect pests. Anihrenus infestations require up to 20 days at 77&quot; F (2S°C). At 95°F (3S°C), this tin period is reduced to four days. Some postulate that insects and their eggs respire rapid in an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide and die from its toxic effects.</p>

<p><h6>Cold storage and temperature extremes.</h6> Large department stores, wholesale dealer and warehouses depend upon cold storage to protect articles subject to attack by cloth moths and carpet beetles. However, a difference exists between holding uninfested items at a cold temperature to discourage infestation and killing pests in infested items with cold temperatures. Cold storage alone may prevent larvae from feeding, but it does not kill them. Back (193S) and Pinniger (2001) reported that articles will be protected from injury in storage at temperatures ranging from 40°F (4.4°C) to 42°F (S.S°C). However
Mallis (1982) found larvae on garments a short time after removal from cold storage. He found them alive after from six to 12 months at a temperature of 40°F (4.4°C). The resultant adults laid many eggs that hatched normally. Therefore, if infested articles are to treated with cold to kill the pests, acclimation must be taken into account.</p>

<p>
Fields (1992) reported on experiments with temperature acclimation. He found that non-acclimated insects were killed more rapidly when they were first exposed to a sublethal cold temperature. He found that with insects acclimated to temperature of between 50°F and 68°F (10°C to 20°C), the survival rate was two to 10 times higher than in those not acclimated to cool temperatures. He believes that one of the mechanisms for survival during the acclimation period may be the production of glycol and other solutes. Strang (1992) compiled extensive data on temperature extremes that control 46 museum insect pests, Strang (1995) described conditions under which museum artifacts can be damaged with temperature extremes.</p>


<p><h6>Freezing.</h6> Pinniger (200l) reported that freezing is a widely used treatment for many museum objects. However, freezing can pose risks to fragile materials (Florian 1986, 1990). Strang (1992) outlined detailed guidelines for museum pest insect control with low temperatures. Preparations are very important when freezing an object. Care must be taken to eliminate the potential for condensation on the item as it freezes and thaws. Raphael (1994) and Pinniger (200l) outlined preparation considerations. Objects should be sealed in plastic bags. As much air as possible should be evacuated from the bag. Relative humidity should be as close to 50% as possible. A freezer that is not self-defrosting should be used. Freezer units used should be able to maintain at least -18°C, but units that can maintain -30°C will be more efficient. Recommended times are as follows: two weeks at - 18°C, seven days at -25°C, or three days at -30°C. It must be kept in mind that it is the internal temperature of the object that is important, not the thermometer on the freezer unit. After the treatment, the objects should be allowed to return to room tempera­ture within the sealed plastic bag to prevent condensation damage.</p>

<p><h6>Heat treatment.</h6> Careful consideration must be used before selecting heat as a treatment alternative for fragile objects as irreparable damage may occur (Pinniger 2001). Heat is not generally recommended for fabrics, glued items, or oil paintings (Potter 1997b). Heat, however, can be a more rapid method than freezing to eliminate pest infestations. Most fabric pests will be killed within a few hours at 55°C. If possible, water should be added o the environment to reduce drying of the item. It is the internal temperature of the item hat must achieve 55°C. Pinniger (2001) described some ongoing research in this area.</p>

<p>Heating large spaces to control insects has been a successful alternative to pesticides. &#39;\ patented process to use heat to kill all insects in a tented structure was developed by Forbes and Ebeling. Called Thermal Pest Eradication.&quot; the system involves propane fuel heaters, flexible ducting, monitoring devices, blower fans, and tarps (Forbes and Ebeling 1987). While targeting the heat level of the air at 140°F to 150°F (60°C to 65°C), great care is required to distribute the heat evenly or excessive heat pockets could damage sensitive materials. Wool might also serve as an insulator, allowing the pests to escape excessive tem­peratures. Patience would need to be employed to ensure thorough penetration of the heated air.</p>


<p><h6>Microwaves.</h6> Although Pinniger (2001) reported that microwaves have been used in the past for rapid treatment of books, papers and herbarium specimens, they are not frequently used due to the potential of localized overheating. Reagon et al. (1980) tested all stages of the webbing clothes moth on wool swatches in a Sharp CarouseL Microwave oven (2,450 MHz). It took three minutes to kill adults and four minutes to kill the eggs and larvae.</p>


<p><h6>Humidity.</h6> The level of relative humidity plays a major role in the survival of sever fabric pests, particularly the clothes moth. This factor could explain the low incidence the webbing clothes moth in some southern states where lower humidity is found many air-conditioned homes, and also in heated northern homes during the winter. Busvine (1980) claimed the optimum relative humidity for the webbing clothes moth is 75%. Controlling relative humidity is an important aspect of storing museum objects (Pinnige 2001). Relative humidities acceptable for insect control might be unfavorable for object storage. in general, keeping relative humidity levels below 55%-60% is helpful and below 75% is essential.</p>


<p><h6>Biological control.</h6> This method does not hold much promise in the museum environment due to the normal zero tolerance for pests in museums (Pinniger 2001). Biological control is generally based on the presumption that a certain level of pests is acceptable maintain the parasite population; this is unacceptable when dealing with objects that can be irreparably damaged by one chewed hole. However, Plarre et al. (1999) and Takacs al. (1997) researched Apanteles carpatus as a possible biological control method for the clothes moth. Their research holds out some hope that this may become a viable alternative in the future.</p>


<p><h6>Natural repellents.</h6> Plarre et al. (1997) found oil of cloves, citral and citronellol scented with oil of lavender to show promising repellent effect against the webbing clothes mot Egwunyenga et al. (1998) found that extracts from the pepper fruit, Dennettia tripeta/: were more repellent to the hide beetle than pyrethrum. Neither of these repellents currently commercially available; however, alternatives such as these may hold promise in a future where there are very few pesticide choices.</p>

<p><h6>Anti-feedants.</h6> Zaitseva (1987), of the Research Institute for Restoration (VNIIR) Moscow, found that many of the more common dermestid larvae have poor olfactory sense. It seems logical, therefore, that chemical anti-feedants incorporated into museum objects would deter larval feeding by migrating dermestids. A persistent anti-feedant, the well-known insect repellent carboxide (hexamethylene carbamide), was selected from 50 compounds being tested as one with promise. It is proposed that the impregnation .. packing and other materials with carboxide solutions (not to be confused with the brar&quot; name Carboxide, the name given by Union Carbide Corp. for its ethylene oxide/carbon dioxide fumigant gas mixture) will prevent infestation by dermestid larvae. This approach may be useful as part of an integrated pest management program for dermestid control = museums.</p>

<p><h6>Insect Growth Regulators.</h6> As the search for non-pesticidal alternatives continues, some search has been done on tebufenozide, an ecdysone mimic. Gerard and Ruf (1994) found that this product showed promise for protection of fabrics from Lepidopteran fab­ric pests, but more research is required.</p>


<p><strong>INSECTICIDE TREATMENTS.</strong> Of all the household pests, fabric pests are among the most difficult to control because of all the potential food sources available in a home, particularly an older home. In a chronic (long-term) infestation, the larvae and adults become very widely distributed, wandering from one food source to another, or they may find some hidden and obscure crevice that protects them from treatments. The larvae may then reappear a day or so after the control measures have been applied. However, very often, the cast skins of the larvae accumulate in one locality, giving the impression of a more extensive infestation than is actually the case. As with any !PM program, insecti­cides can be used as a tool when appropriate.</p>


<p><h6>Liquid and Dust Residuals.</h6> Because fabric pests often hide in cracks and voids, the majority of pesticide treatments will involve crack and crevice and void treatments. Such sites are best treated with an inorganic dust, such as silica aerogel or diatomaceous earth, though the pyrethroid dusts also will be effective. Hedges and Lacey (1996) recommended applying a dust insecticide under the edge of carpeting at the baseboards in infested rooms and closets.</p>

<p>
Some spot treatments will be needed from time to time. This is particularly true when natural fiber carpeting needs to be treated. Wettable powders and microencapsulated prod­ucts are best to use in a closet or dresser. Treatment along carpeted areas or underneath furniture or rugs is best achieved using an emulsifiable concentrate insecticide. Oriental rugs and furniture are best handled and cleaned by a professional. Some fabric dyes are not colorfast and can be ruined by the use of water. Small, inconspicuous areas should be treated prior to full treatment to insure no discoloration or staining. Unless the full amount of liquid recommended on the label is used, there is danger that the base of the fiber will ot be treated. Fabric pests usually nip the base of the fiber. The cross-section area of a fiber is a tiny fraction of the surface area of the entire fiber. Broadcast treatments are not necessary. Keep in mind the feeding habits of these pests, and focus treatments in dark, secluded areas.</p>

<p>
Void treatments are often necessary when a bird or insect nest is removed from a structure, After removal of the nest&#39;s remains, a dust formulation can be injected into the fall void or attic soffit where the nest was located. Dead insects in attics may require that the attic be treated as a large void space by pest management professionals. Care must be taken to avoid treatment over or onto any personal belongings the homeowner may have placed in the attic for storage.</p>


<p><h6>Nonresidual Insecticides.</h6> The use of an Actisol&quot; or Micro-Injector&quot; machine provides excellent penetration for those hard-to-reach areas, particularly inside insulated wall voids where dust insecticides penetrate poorly. Space treatments can also be used to kill adult beetles and moths. However, the insecticide droplets in such treatments travel only where air carries them, and no significant penetration occurs to hidden sites where larvae ar adults may hide (Katz 1984).</p>

<p><h6>Fumigation.</h6> Where a carpet beetle infestation is severe, pest management professionals may resort to fumigation. Treatment with a fumigant gas is the surest way for penetrate numerous layers of fabrics or rolled rugs and quickly destroys all forms of fabric pests infested materials. Fumigation is completed inside fumigation chambers, trailers, shipping containers, fumigation bubbles, or by tarping the structure. Some museums, libraries, and pest control companies have fumigation vaults for treatment of infested artifact Fumigators must be careful that the gas penetrates infested pockets in sufficient concentrations to kill larvae and adults. Fumigation has no residual effect and reinfestation may occur shortly after fumigation. Sulfuryl fluoride (Vikane™), when used for household fumigation against carpet beetles, requires the same dosage as for dry wood termites, by two fumigations spaced months apart. Methyl bromide, although highly effective again fabric pests, will soon not be an option for fumigation. It was not often a choice for the; pests due to the potential odorous effect it might have on items containing high amount of sulfur.</p>

<p>
Another new method of fumigating efficiently with inert gases is currently in use the United Kingdom by the Rentokil Group, a well-known pest control firm with offices throughout the world. This fumigation system has been introduced to the United States for use in food and fiber fumigations, as well as for use in museums, libraries, and valuable collections. It consists of a very tough, plastic-coated fabric tent. Goods to be fumigated are placed inside the bubble, the air evacuated, and the fumigant gas introduce The quality of the design is such that several kinds of non-flammable/non-explosive gas may be used as the fumigant.</p>


<p><h6>Mild fumigants.</h6> Naphthalene and paradichlorobenzene (PDB) are somewhat common used by homeowners against clothes moths and carpet beetles. Abbot and Billings (1935) showed that paradichlorobenzene, naphthalene, and the cedar oils neither repel cloth moths or keep them from depositing eggs and do not discourage the larvae from feeding on articles, Billings concluded that these materials have no repellent action, but they do have some fumigation value. Coleman (1940b) found low concentrations of paradichlrobenzene vapors inhibited the feeding of the black carpet beetle. Arnold (1957) show, under practical conditions PDB is not an effective repellent against the black carpet beetle.</p>

<p>
Naphthalene and PDB are slowly volatile at room temperatures and under strict conditions act as fumigants to kill moths. To be effective they must be used in tight containers, at proper dosage, and the period of exposure must be sufficient to kill. The odor alone does not repel moths. PDB kills more effectively and rapidly than naphthalene (Linn and Keatinge, 2000).</p>

<p>
Parker (1990a) found that hard plastics such as polystyrene or Styrofoam can me as can buttons and ornamentation on clothing when PDB is used. PDB can scrat Plexiglas™ and injure many resins and furniture finishes, as well as fade cellulose acetate dyes. Serious damage can occur to museum specimens with paradichlorobenze crystals."</p>
