<h1>Opossums</h1>
<h2>Class Mammalia, Order Marsupialia, Family Didelphidae</h2>
<p>

"The opossum, Didelphis virginiana, is the only marsupial native to the U.S., and it often becomes a pest in and around buildings.  Where numerous, they may den beneath dwellings or porches or take up residence within attics or outbuildings.  They frequently raid uncovered garbage cans and tear open plastic garbage bags set out for disposal.  Their nighttime prowling often arouses kenneled or leashed dogs, causing them to bard.  In rural areas, poultry or eggs are sometime preyed upon.<p>

Opossums have been involved in the transmission of tularemia to humans and should not be handled or skinned without protective gloves.  Additionally, they have been reported to be infected with, and may be carriers of, a number of other diseases, including leptospirosis, relapsing fever, murine typhus, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.  Fortunately very few cases of rabies have been reported in opossums, and laboratory evidence suggests that adult opossums are quite resistant to rabies infections, although the young are more susceptible.  Opossums are often heavily infested with ectoparasites."<p>
