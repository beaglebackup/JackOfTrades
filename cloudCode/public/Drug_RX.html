<p><strong>Control.</strong> "Complete control of the drugstore beetle can only be achieved if the infested material is found and treated or destroyed.  Extreme temperatures can be effective in controlling infestations.  Fumigation with phosphine and methyl bromide fumigants has been effective.  Space treatments with contact insecticides have been useful where the source of infestation has not been found, but repeat applications will be necessary.  Applications of residual insecticides to areas where vulnerable items are stored will help eliminate residual beetle populations and prevent reinfestation of incoming materials.  These beetles are attracted to lights and fly readily when temperatures are above 65ºF (18ºC).  Light traps can also be useful in catching residual beetles."</p>
