<h1>
Western
Subterranean Termite</h1>
<h2>Reticulitermes
Hesperus Banks</h2>

<p>This
termite is as abundant in the western United States as R. flavipes is
in the East.  It is commonly encountered along the entire Pacific
Coast from British Columbia south into lower California and western
Mexico and eastward into Idaho and Nevada.</p>

<p>The
biology and habits of R. Hesperus are similar to those of the eastern
subterranean termite.  As with other Reticulitermes species, colony
growth from a primary pair is low.  Even under highly favorable
conditions swarms cannot be expected before the third or fourth year.
 Pickens (1932) and Weesner (1956) reviewed the biology, colony
initiation, and economic significance of this species.</p>

<p>The
eastern and western subterranean termites are similar in overall
appearance, although R. Hesperus swarmers tend to be a bit larger. 
It is important to be able to distinguish this species from the
western drywood termite, Incisitermes minor, since their swarming
periods overlap.  (I. minor swarmers are somewhat larger, and the
head and thorax are reddish brown.)  In California, swarming usually
occurs on warm, sunny days during autumn, winter, or early spring
since this corresponds with the rainy season (Ebeling 1978).  As with
eastern subterranean termites, swarming takes place during the
daytime.</p>

<p>Foraging
activity of R. Hesperus in California increases in late spring, peaks
in summer and is minimal during winter.  Population studies with
Reticulitermes in California further suggest there may be numerous
relatively small colonies coexisting in the same area with
populations ranging from 5,000-500,000 foragers (Haagsma and Rust
1995; Haverty et al. 1999a, 2000).  Field studies in southern
California found that foraging populations of R. Hesperus were
significantly larger in urban populated areas than in undeveloped
native scrub sage habitats.  Plentiful irrigation and an abundance of
trees, shrubs, and wood framed structures in populated areas
apparently afforded ideal conditions for population growth.  Smith
and Rust (1994) observed that R. Hesperus workers in southern
California preferred soil temperatures between 84°F to 90°F (29°C to
32°C) and were never found at temperatures above 104°F (40°C).  They
concluded that termites foraging close to the soil surface might seek
refuge from the heat under objects large enough to cast thermal
shadow.  Building could be providing an ideal refuge from hot
temperatures, and thus, concentrating foraging populations in the
vicinity of structures.</p>

<p>Although
the western subterranean termite has been considered the predominant
termite species in California, recent findings suggest there may
actually be multiple. Closely related Reticulitermes species
previously all thought to be R. Hesperus (Haverty and Nelson 1997;
Haverty 1999b).  Sophisticated new diagnostic techniques, many
involving DNA “fingerprinting,” will almost certainly reveal
additional new termite species in the future.”</p>
