<h1>Paper Wasp</h1>
<h2>(Polistes fuscatus)</h2>

<p><strong>Background Information.</strong>  
Paper wasps are also known as umbrella wasps because their nests look
like upside down umbrellas. 
</p>

<p><strong>Distribution &amp; Habitat.</strong> 
Nests are typically found in high, protected areas like the eaves of
houses, garage, attics and other similar areas. Nests are made of a
wood pulp, which is where paper wasps get their name. 
</p>

<p><strong>Identification.</strong> Paper wasps are
approximately 3/4 to 1 inch long. They have bright yellow and black
banding. 
</p>

<p><strong>Life Cycle.</strong> Paper wasps
can have up to 7 fertile queens in a nest at a time, although only
the original queen is dominant and lays the eggs. Each nest can
produce up to 200 eggs per summer. These eggs take an average of 48
days to go from egg to adult. Queens are able to overwinter and begin
a new nest in the spring.
