“<font face="Chalkboard, serif">As with most pest problems, control
depends on sanitation, source reductions, and exclusion.  Flea larval
habitats should be vacuumed to remove organic material (“flea
dirt”) service as food, then treated with an insect developmental
inhibitor.  Once the animal has been treated with a veterinary
product providing sustained flea protection, environmental
modification to exclude wildlife and feral animals from the area is
needed to prevent flea reinfestation.  </font>

 Mechanical or physical control procedures will be conducted
primarily by the homeowner.  Education of the client on important
aspects of flea biology is essential if any degree of compliance is
expected.  Helpful procedures include having the homeowner wash the
pet’s blanket, throw rugs, and pet carrier, and vacuum pet sleeping
and resting areas thoroughly to help remove flea eggs, larvae, and
dried adult feces.  Seat cushions and pillows on sofas and chairs
should be removed and vacuumed as well as crevices in sofas and
chairs.  Areas where pets like to sleep or rest are especially
important, including under beds and in closets.  It is important that
because cats climb, sources of fleas may be found on windowsills and
shelving above floor level.</font></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Chalkboard, serif">Regular
use of a vacuum device with a beater bar not only removes a number of
flea eggs and larvae, it also stimulates pre-emerged adult fleas to
emerge from cocoons (Osbrink et.al 1986).  Vacuum bags should be
discarded in outdoor trash receptacles after vacuuming.</font></p>

should be taken to exclude pets, raccoons, rats, opossums, squirrels,
and other possible flea hosts from entering chimneys, crawlspaces,
attics, and beneath porches.  Many times, dogs and other pets that
are allowed to seek shade under the house or deck on a hot summer day
can lead to a rapid buildup of a heavy concentration of fleas.</font></p>

 The most critical factor in long-term relief from flea infestations
is treatment of  the pets to stop continued reinfestation of the
premises.  In general, such treatments should be conducted by the
homeowner under the direction of their veterinarian although many
over-the-counter products may be available to pet owners. 
Permethrin, fipronil, imidacloprid, and lufenuron are a few of the
common active ingredients encountered.  Such products have been so
successful that pest management professionals receive vastly fewer
calls today to control fleas in homes than before the mid-1990s. 
Flea collars also continue to be a popular flea control method
although their effectiveness varies.  </font>

 It is important to point out that before the use of any insecticide,
the label should be read and thoroughly understood by the applicator.
 Insecticides are currently available for flea control inside or
outside of buildings.</font></p>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Chalkboard, serif">Successful
applications for flea control indoors depend on thoroughness,
including treatment of the entire carpeted or rug surface.  Byron and
Robinson (1986) highlighted the importance of property maintained
equipment and proper application techniques for good flea control. 
Control efforts should be focused on those areas frequented by pets
and areas where eggs may accumulate, such as in cracks of floor
boards, behind baseboards, in ventilators, under edges of carpets,
and where larval development is likely.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Chalkboard, serif">Successful
control of fleas in carpeting is directly related to proper
application techniques and application of the proper rate of
insecticide.  Thorough coverage by overlapping strokes to areas where
fleas may be developing is critical to achieving good penetration and
subsequent contact and kill of adult fleas.  Larvae escape most
adulticide treatments indoors because the treatment fails to contact
them at the base of carpet fibers where they develop, and the larvae
require more insecticide per gram of body weight to kill them than
adults do (Dryden and Rust 1994).  Therefore, insect growth
regulators (IGRs) are highly important in flea control.  Methoprene
and pyriproxyfen mimic the activity of juvenile hormone and are
classified as juvenile hormone analogs (JHAs).  Juvenile hormone is
involved in regulating the molting process of insects.  When insects
molt from one larval stage to the next, levels of juvenile hormone
are relatively high and are responsible for maintaining larval
characteristics.  Continued presence of a juvenile hormone mimic,
such as methoprene, results in flea larvae failing to molt into
adults, thus interrupting the flea life cycle.  Mehtoprene and
pyriproxyfen also have significant ovicidal activity and are
effective in on-animal treatments by contacting flea eggs as they are
deposited onto and then fall off the animal.</font></p>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Chalkboard, serif">The
flea pupa and pre-emerged adult are the life stages most difficult to
control in flea programs.  Most flea treatments appear to fail
because very few  flea pupae and pre-emerged adults are killed when
insecticides are applied to carpets (Rust and Reierson 1989).  These
life stages are found inside a silk cocoon within the carpet fiber
matrix.  Dryden and Reid (1996) found that cocoons are not a barrier
to insecticides.  Survival of developing pupae in insecticide-treated
households is not due to any protection afforded by cocoons but
because of the lack of penetration of the carpet canopy by the
insecticide.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%"><font face="Chalkboard, serif">Following
the treatment of carpeting and other surfaces, flea pupae will
continue to develop and adult fleas will continue to emerge from
cocoons for the next two to four weeks (occasionally longer).  While
most residual insecticides exhibit activity for several weeks, these
compounds generally do not have a quick “knockdown” rate. 
Therefore, insecticide causes its death, allowing sufficient time for
the fleas to find a dog or cat or client calls for extra service. 
Education of homeowners concerning this phenomenon is critical to
reduce these “callbacks.”  Homeowners otherwise will assume that
the control measures undertaken have failed.  Generally, flea
populations will be under complete control within three to five
weeks.</font></p>

OF FLEAS OUTDOORS</font></font><font face="Chalkboard, serif">. 
Elimination of fleas in the yard can be an important aspect of flea
control, but several important points must be considered.  Those
areas protected from direct sunlight and where the soil is moist will
provide adequate conditions for flea development (Osbring et al.
1986).  Therefore, flea development outdoors is concentrated in
protected microhabitats, such as dog houses, within garages, under
porches, and in animal lounging areas beneath shrubs or other shaded
areas.”</font></p>
