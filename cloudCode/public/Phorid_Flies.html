<h1>Phorid Flies</h1>
<h2>Family Phoridae</h2>

<p>“Hedges
(1994) discussed phorid flies in detail and much of the following is
from his text.  Phorid flies are small flies up to 1/8 inch (3 mm) in
length including the wings.   They are usually tan to dark brown in
color.  A key character is the severe arch, or humpbacked shape, of
its thorax compared with its small head, thus giving it the
nickname:hump-backed fly”.  The phorid fly lacks the red eyes of
the fruit fly –the fly with which it is most often confused.  The
wings of the phorid fly also have two heavily sclerotized veins at
the top of the wing, and the remaining veins are very weak and are
not joined by cross veins.  Adult flies have the peculiar habit of
running rapidly along surfaces instead of immediately flying when
disturbed.</p>

<p>Phorid
flies are found throughout the world and are a serious pest in all
types of food-handling facilities.  They are primarily breed in and
feed on moist, decaying organic matter and probably have the greatest
variety of potential breeding sites of any type of fly.  Examples
include decaying bodies/animals, glue, paint, garbage, and drains. 
In fact, any material of an organic nature that remains wet can be
utilized by this fly.  Because they frequent unsanitary areas, phorid
flies could potentially carry pathogenic bacteria and other
microorganisms onto food products.  These flies may also by referred
to as “coffin” flies because they are common in mortuaries and
mausoleums.</p>

<p>Trash
containers that are not cleaned regularly are a good source for
phorid flies.  Trash containers that become breeding sources for
flies are usually those that are not lined with bags.  Phorid flies
will also breed in any moist decaying organic matter trapped in
cracks of kitchen equipment or under the base of such equipment where
it meets the floor.  Many restaurants, bakeries, and food processing
facilities use hoses to wash the floor clean each night.  Water under
pressure can force food debris and moisture into the cracks under
equipment.  Phorid flies may deposit eggs at each point in the
facility where this occurs.</p>

<p>Other
sites where phorid flies may be found in structures include garbage
disposals, rotting meat and vegetables, the over-watered soil of
potted plants, and fresh-cut flowers in vases.  They also have been
found breeding in dirty mops in janitor closets and laundry rooms,
animal feces, faulty septic systems, and human cadavers.  Pet stores,
zoological parks, and even homes where pets are kept in terrariums
can experience problems with phorid flies.  The flies breed in moist,
decaying organic matter in the bottom of unclean cages.  
</p>

<p>The
most difficult situations involving phorid flies occur when a drain
line breaks or leaks under the slab floor of a hospital, hotel, or
other large building.  Over a period of months or years, wet organic
matter accumulates under the slab and literally hundreds of thousands
of flies can develop.  Determining whether a sub-slab infestation is
present usually requires cutting a core through the concrete to
examine the soil beneath and to check for adult flies.  Such an
effort should be attempted only if a previous drain leak was present
and repaired, a current leak is known, and/or all other potential
breeding sources have been eliminated.</p>

<p><strong>Life History.</strong>  Phorid
flies are a particular concern in hospitals and other health care
facilities.  Phorid fly larvae have been found in open wounds of
patients and in laboratory petri dishes, resulting in contamination
due to bacteria that might be found on their bodies.  The tiny eggs
are deposited on or near the surface of decaying organic matter.  The
female will deposited on or near the surface of decaying organic
matter.  The female will deposit about 20 eggs at a time; about 40
eggs during a 12-hour period.  The larvae emerge within 24 hours and
feed for eight to 16 days depending on the food source and
temperature.  The larvae then crawl to a drier spot to pupate under
ideal conditions, the life cycle from egg to adult can be completed
as quickly as 14 days, but may take as long as 37 days.”</p>
