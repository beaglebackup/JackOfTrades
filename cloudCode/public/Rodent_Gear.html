<p><strong>Snap Traps for Rats.</strong>  USPHS (1948)  provided the following recommendations and comments regarding rat trapping, and some of these have been modified for this and earlier editions of this handbook.<p>

1.  The trigger of a set trap should be parallel to the body of a trap when in its most sensitive position.<p>

2.  For greasing traps for smooth operation, use lard or some other animal fat.  These "lubricants" will prevent  a possible reppellency effect that might occur with machine oils.  A trap whose metal parts are wiped with bacon rind will be protected from rust for some time and also will be attractive to rats.<p>

3.  Evidence exists that a previously successful trap is more effective than a clean unused trap.  It is likely that rodents are influenced positively by the pheromones and general odors of other rodents in the community.<p>

4.  Human odors on traps are not likely to deter most rodents as our odors are usually present on he various objects rodents investigate consume.  Moreover, the odors associated with human touch only last for about three hours (Taylor et al. 1974).<p>

5.  When trapping rats, snap traps should be placed, but left uset and baited for a couple of days prior to setting the traps.<p>

6.  More rats are usually trapped on the first night than on any other night.  After three to four nights of snap trap use, the catch rate may drop to zero.  For this reason, it is essential t distribute a large number of traps initially.  In commercial facilities, the number of traps used may range from 20 to 100 traps, depending upon the degree of infestation and the availability of potential trap locations.<p>

7.  For trap-shy rats, the trap can be buried in a shallow pan of meal, sawdust, or grain with the trigger protruding, first making sure the action of the trigger will not be clogged by the material beneath it.  For best results, however, the traps should be left unset for a few days.  Once rats are interacting with the traps, the baits should be tied to the treadle with dental floss or a rubber band, thus making certain the rat sets off the trigger.<p>

8.  Where a hole in the floor used by the rodents is present, place several traps in a semicircle 2 or 3 feet from the opening.<p>

9.  When unbaited traps are set on runways on floors, shelves, or other wide surfaces, place the traps in the run about 1 or 2 inches away from the wall or other surface.<p>

10.  Baited traps should be set 8 to 12 inches from the surface followed by rat runs, so trapped rats will no be directly in the line of travel.  It is advisable to use baited and unbaited traps alternately along floor runs, spacing them in accordance with the total number of traps required to catch the number of rats using the runway.<p>

11.  To monitor for remaining rats after a large trapping program, talcum powder patches can be used to monitor for new tracks."<p>

<p><strong>Ultrasonic Devices.</strong>  "Ultrasonic machines generate sounds which are beyond those of human hearing (greater than 20 kHz).  Rats can hear within a  range of up to 100 kHz and mice up to 90 kHz.<p>

As of 2003, ultrasonic machines are still sold widely over-the-counter in hardware stores and neighborhood "mart" stores, as well as in garden and specialty tool catalogs of all types.  Some researchers (McCartnet and Jackson 1986, 1988) reported that wild rodents in field situations can be affected by ultrasonic machines, and their normal activities and travel routes can be altered.  Thus, it may be possible to channel rodents into desired areas, or possibly repel them from specific areas."<p>

<p>Handbook of Pest Control; Mallis, Ninth Edition. Pages 74-75</p>

<p><strong>Electromagnetic Devices.</strong>  "Electromagnetic devices are supposed to work on the principle that a magnetic field produces a barrier that has a stunning or repellent effect on rodents.  Sometimes, electromagnetic devices are confused with ultrasonic devices; however, the two are entirely difference.  As of 1996, however, at least one company still markets a machine which claims to incorporate both electromagnetic and ultrasonic effects.<p>

Pest Control magazine (Anonymous 1977) reported after interviewing some of the top experts in the country, that no scientific evidence is available to show these devices work.  In 1979, EPA had obtained federal court orders prohibiting the sale of several electromagnetic devices because they did not work (Anonymous 1979a).  Despite this, advertisements for such devices can still occasionally be seen.   Nothing has changed as of 2003 - such devices would have no more effect on rodents than a common household appliance (Frantz and Davis 1991).  Their use should be avoided."<p>

<p><strong>Controlling with Rodenticides.</strong>  "Rodenticides are pesticides that kill rodents, and modern rodenticides consist of two broad groups: anticoagulants and non-anticoagulants.<p>

The older rodenticides Antu, arsenic, barium carbonate, DDT, norbormide, phosphorous paste, red squil, sodium fluoroacetate (compound 1080), strychnine, and thallium sulfate, and the anticoagulants coumafuryl, pindone, and isovaleryl indandione (e.g., Pival) are either no longer registered, used rarely, or are no longer used in most commensal rodent programs because of the more efficarious and/or less hazardous modern rodenticides.  Thus, these compounds will not be discussed in the edition.  Also, the rodenticides used in other countries, but not registered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for commercial use in the U.S. are also not discussed.  Readers interested in the early rodenticides should consult earlier editions of the Handbook of Pest Control.  In-detail discussions on old and new rodenticides used around the world are provided by Meehan (1984), Prakash (1988) and Buckle and Smith (1994).<p>

<p><strong>Anticoagulants.</strong>  The anticoagulant rodenticides comprise about 90% or more of the baits used by pest management professionals.  Anticoagulant rodenticides cause death as a result of internal bleeding which occurs as the animal's blood loses its clotting ability and capillaries are destroyed.  The active ingredients are used a low levels of from 25 ppm to 50 ppm.  All anticoagulant rodenticides are relatively slow-acting; death ranges from three days to 10 days following the ingestion of a lethal amount of bait depending on the particular active ingredient.  Bait shyness does not occur with anticoagulant rodenticides.  Because of the addition of more advanced anticoagulants are now classified as first-generation and second-generation anticoagulants.<p>
