<h1>Fungus Gnats</h1>
<h2>Families Fungivoridae and Sciaridae</h2>

<p>“Fungus
gnats belong to the family Fungivoridae (formerly Mycetophilidae) and
family Sciaridae.  These flies are generally small, dark flies with
long thin wings and legs.  They are characterized by the inordinately
long first segment of the legs called the coxa.  The species of
family Sciaridae are commonly referred to as the dark winged fungus
gnats due to the smoky color of their wings.

<p>According
to Sollers (1950), fungus gnats, at times, occur in the home where
ferns and other houseplants containing soil rich in humus serve as
breeding source.  Outdoors, the larvae live in fungi, damp soil, or
decayed vegetable matter.  In commercial buildings, fungus gnats can
be found breeding in the soil in atriums as well as in potted plants.
 Usually the soil is overwatered which allows the growth of fungi on
which the larvae feed.  These flies are harmless, yet they are
annoying when found indoors.  They are attracted to lights are
commonly seen in windows.</p>

<p>The
control of fungus gnats in buildings is simple the soil or wetted
site in which they are breeding must be found and then dried out. 
The top 2 or 3 inches (5.0 to 7.6 cm) of soil should be overturned to
speed drying, after which the larvae will die.  For potted plants, it
is important to thoroughly clean the overflow sauces underneath pots
as the larvae will breed in these plates.  The watering schedule for
the plants should be changed to prevent these conditions from
recurring.</p>

<p>Hedges
(1994) was consulted on a fungus gnat problem in a hotel.  The hotel
contained a large aviary atrium in which many valuable birds were
housed.  Bird feces in the soil, together with excess watering of
plants, promoted the growth of fungi on which thousands of fungus
gnat larvae were feeding. After a period of time, adult flies were
found flying throughout the first two floors of the hotel. 
Insecticides could not be used because of the birds.  The problem was
solved by changing the plant watering schedule, installing large fans
to blow over the surface of the soil to dry it out and raking the top
several inches of soil to speed drying.  Electric light traps were
effective in attracting and killing large numbers of the remaining
adult fungus gnats.</p>

<p>
Baur (1984) related a story of a
fungus gnat infestation not associated with soil.  A geodesic dome
home was constructed using foam insulation inside the walls. 
Evidently moisture was trapped inside with the foam insulation and
allowed fungi to grow in the walls.  The fungus gnats began breeding
in large numbers in the walls and feeding on the fungi.  The breeding
site of the gnats was confirmed by placing tape around electric
outlets that captured gnats as they attempted to exit.  Covering the
home with tarps and fumigating with methyl bromide eliminated the
infestation.  Baur noted that the problem might have been resolved
without fumigating.  Once the house was covered by tarps, the warm
temperature of the day caused moisture in the walls to evaporate,
drying out the gnat breeding area inside the walls.”</p>
