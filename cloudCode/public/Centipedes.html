<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“<font face="Avenir Book, serif">Centipedes
are flattened, elongated animals with one pair of legs on most of
their body segments.  The total number of legs varies from 10 to more
than 100, depending on the species.  Centipedes have many-jointed
antennae and jaws connected to poison glands to kill insects and
other small creatures for food.  The bite of a centipede, even the
largest species found in the United States, is not sufficiently toxic
to be lethal to humans, or even small children.  It is usually
comparable to a wasp sting (Smith 1982).</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Ordinarily,
centipedes dwell outdoors in damp locations, beneath accumulations of
leaves, stones, boards, etc., and when disturbed they run swiftly. 
Individual centipedes sometimes crawl into the house and conceal
themselves in various articles.  Only the house centipede occurs in
more than a few individuals within a building.</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">House
Centipede.  Back (1939a) noted the house centipede, Scutigera
coleoptrata (Linnaeus), “has a wormlike body, an inch or more in
length, with a pair of very long, slender antennae springing from the
head, and with 15 pairs of long legs arranged along the sides of its
body, the last pair being much more than twice the length of the body
in the female.”  The body of this grayish-yellow centipede is
marked with three longitudinal dark stripers, and the legs are
encircled with alternating dark and white bands.  The last pair of
hind legs is modified to “lasso” and hold its victims.  There are
six larval instars and four post-larval instars before maturity.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">This
centipede is now found throughout the United States, but it is native
to Mexico.  It lives outdoors and indoors, and in the home, the house
centipede occurs in moist cellars, damp closets, and bathrooms, where
it feeds on insects and spiders.  During a one-year period, more than
200 house centipedes were found in a sump pump in the basement of a
house near Pittsburgh.  The weak jaws of the house centipede can
penetrate the skin only with difficulty.  Curran (1946) stated there
are several records where the bite resulted in swelling and pain, but
usually it is no worse than that of a bee sting.</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“<font face="Avenir Book, serif">Giant”
Centipedes.  Some of the centipedes (Scolopendra spp.) of the
Southeast and Southwest are impressive, sometimes reaching a length
of 8 inches (20 cm).  One of the most impressive is the giant desert,
Scolopendra heros, found in Arizona and Southern California.  This
species has dark blue head and posterior “pseudohead” to confuse
predators.  If the “pseudohead” is grabbed, the real head is free
to bite.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">According
to Smith (1982), the bite usually causes local inflammation, redness,
and swelling – and occasionally systemic symptoms – that
disappear in four to five hours.  Occasionally, people bitten have
reported “swelling and tenderness for several weeks with occasional
suppuration and slow healing of the wound.”  Logan et al. (1985)
reported an incident of rhabdomyolysis (disintegration of skeletal
muscle tissue) accompanied by acute renal failure following the bite
of the giant desert centipede Scolopendra heros.  Recovery was
incomplete four weeks after the bite.  Textbooks have described bites
of scolopendrid centipedes as painful but not life threatening;
however, they may be life threatening to certain presensitized
individuals as seen with bee and wasp stings.”</font></p>
