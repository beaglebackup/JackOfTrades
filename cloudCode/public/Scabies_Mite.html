is but one of a number of varieties of the same species (Arlian
1989).  There can be “horse scabies” or “dog scabies” which
are actually the same species but not adapted to humans.  Sarcoptes
scabei is of greater interest to the doctor than to the pest
management professional since its treatment and control must be
accomplished under a physician’s care.  It is considered briefly at
this point, however, since symptoms due to the itch mite may be
confused with those caused by other mites and insects.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">The
itch mite is from 0.25 to 0.5 mm in length and is commonly found in
the webbing between fingers and the folds of the wrists, on the
elbows, behind the knees, around the nipples, and on and around the
genitals.  The female burrows beneath the outer layer of skin,
leaving at first a small papule, but if allowed to continue, will
leave red sinuous trails along the skin for perhaps as much as 2 to 3
cm.  Perhaps one of the interesting facets of this pest is that, even
after successful medical treatment, affected people may continue to
experience severe itching for up to a month.  On the other hand,
newly infested humans rarely experience any itching or discomfort
(this is related to the developing immune response).  For this
reason, scabies infections may be well established by the time
infestation is apparent and treatment is sought.</font></p>

<font face="Avenir Book, serif">The entire life cycle from egg to
adult takes from nine to 11 days for the males and from 14 to 17 days
for the females.</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Mellanby
(1943) found females mites removed from the skin walked about fairly
rapidly at 68*F (20*C).  He found they could easily climb polished
surfaces such as glass.  At 90% relative humidity and 55*F (13*C),
about 50% of the mites survived a week off-host and 5% lived for two
weeks.  Warm dry air causes rapid death.  At 82*F (28*C) most mites
died within 24 hours and none survived longer than two days. 
Transmission of mites is almost entirely by intimate contact.”</font></p>
