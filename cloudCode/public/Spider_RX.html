<h2>MANAGEMENT OF SPIDERS</h2>


<p>
Spiders are beneficial creatures that are helpful in controlling the numbers of insect pests in a structure. Except for a few dangerous species, most are harmless and are seldom  encountered by people. However, spiders frequently stray into dwellings or other indoor  habitats, or may be accidentally introduced on firewood, laundry hung out to dry, in  boxes, and on flowers. Web-building spiders construct webs in windows and near outdoor lighting to catch insects attracted to these locations. The brown recluse spider may  wander inside from outdoor locations or may be carried inside in clothing, boxes, furniture, and other household goods. In any pest management effort, positive identification of the spider involved is key to selection of effective treatment strategies and procedures.</p>
<p>
<strong>INSPECTION AND IDENTIFICATION.</strong> A thorough inspection inside and outside the building is needed to determine the spiders involved, the sources of the infestation, how they are entering, and any contributing conditions. Accurate identification of the spider is especially important in the case of a reported spider bite. Hedges and Lacey (1995) re  potted one case in a manufacturing plant where two workers had reported brown recluse bites, but after extensive inspection and trapping no brown recluse spiders were found in the facility . In this case, the victims had Likely received their bites elsewhere. Monitoring traps are especially useful for determining activity involving active hunter species, such as wolf spiders.</p>

<p>
Inspect outdoors, garages, crawlspaces, attics, and basements, looking for the presence of webs and moving items to check for spiders hiding underneath. A major population of both black widow and brown recluse spiders was found in an elementary school in Mississippi. It was determined they were living in the attic and in the storage room (Lace:  1996). Black widow and brown recluse spiders often build webs in and around boxes and piles of items, and the brown recluse will also harbor in wall voids and under insulation. The presence of web-building spiders is easier to detect than that of hunting spiders.</p>
<p>
<strong>NONCHEMCAL MEASURES.</strong> Nonchemical techniques should comprise the majority  of the control efforts for most spiders in and around structures, especially for web-building spiders. Customers should be advised verbally and in writing about those steps the: need to take to eliminate contributing conditions possibly supporting the infestation. Hedge  (2003) listed the five top spider proofing techniques as (1) changing exterior lighting, (2 eliminating potential harborages, (3) regularly removing spider webs outside, (4) seal in cracks and installing screens, and (5) improving attic and crawlspace ventilation.</p>
<p>
<h6>Sanitation.</h6> Removal of spider webs, egg sacs, and potential harborages is critical to long-term success in spider control. Indoors, store boxes off the floor and away from walls to limit their use by spiders. Seal all openings of boxes with tape to prevent their use as a spider harborage.</p>

<p>
Removal of all new and old webbing allows for easier determination of future spider activity and increases the building owner&#39;s sense that the spiders are being controlled</p>

<p>
Removal or straightening of clutter in storage areas, garages, sheds, basements, or outside eliminates potential web-building sites and is important for the control of brown recluse and black widow spiders.</p>

<p>
In the case of large commercial facilities, establishment of a vegetation-free zone 18 to  20 inches out from the building&#39;s perimeter, covered with plastic and a 2-inch layer of gravel, is beneficial.</p>
<p>
<strong>Exclusion.</strong> Keeping spiders from entering is the best strategy for preventing inside activity. As many cracks as possible in exterior walls should be sealed, and tight-fitting screens should be installed in windows and foundation and attic vents. Tight-fitting weather strips should be present around the edges of all doors, especially at the bottom.</p>
<p>
<h6>Exterior Lighting.</h6> Exterior lights on buildings attract insects and, subsequently, spiders. Mercury vapor lights should be replaced with sodium vapor lights which are less attractive to insects. Outside light fixtures on homes can be equipped with yellow &quot;bug light&quot; bulbs. Hedges (2000) noted a web-building spider problem in an office building in Florida that was solved primarily by changing the exterior lighting.</p>

<p><h6>Ventilation.</h6> Installation of proper ventilation in crawlspaces and attics reduces excess moisture, therefore, reducing insects and the spiders that prey upon them.</p>
<p><h6>Vacuuming.</h6> The use of a vacuum device removes not only individual spiders but also webbing and egg sacs - all in one procedure. Vacuum devices equipped with several extension tubes are useful in the removal of webs and spiders from high corners, rafters, overhead beams, and otherwise unreachable surfaces, Vacuuming is an important technique for controlling black widow spiders and other web-building spiders.</p>

<p><strong>TREATMENTS.</strong> A wide variety of insecticides are la足beled for spider control and are effective when directed to the area of spider activity or potential harborages. Spi足ders are, however, easily disturbed and drop from their webs to seek cover when treatments are applied.</p>

<p><h6>Flushing.</h6> A nonresidual insecticide applied into likely harborage sites can flush hiding spiders and is especially useful when inspecting for species such as wolf or brown recluse spiders.</p>

<p><h6>Directed Contact Treatments.</h6> A nonresidual aerosol insecticide can be directly applied onto an exposed spider.</p>

<p><h6>Spot Treatments.</h6> Residual insecticides can be applied to small surface areas where spiders either may crawl or construct webs. These sites include corners of windows, closets, and along baseboard behind items of furniture or stored items. In basements and crawlspaces, spot treatment. may be applied to sill plates and box headers where web-building spiders often construe their webs. Outdoors, spot treatments can be applied around windows and doors, around exterior light fixtures, under porches, behind down spouts, under eaves, and any sit! where right angles are formed (e.g., corners).</p>

<p><h6>Painting.</h6> A few situations may be encountered where liquid residual insecticides should be applied by painting to prevent drift to nontarget areas. An example might be awnings covering boats at a marina.</p>

<p><h6>Crack and Crevice/Void Treatments.</h6> Any crack or void where spiders might enter the building or where they might harbor should be treated with a residual dust or aerosol insecticide.</p>

<p><h6>Crawlspace and Attic Treatments.</h6> When crawlspaces or attics are relatively dry, a residual dust product can be applied to spots where spiders are active. When treating for brown recluse spiders, it may be important to apply dust under and behind insulation Excessively damp crawlspaces will require spot treatments using a residual wettable powder or microencapsulated insecticide where spiders are active. A water-tolerant dust such as DeltaDust,速 may also be used to treat cracks and voids in such areas.</p>

<p><h6>Space Treatments.</h6> Space (ultra-low-volume or ultra-low-dosage) treatments are generally the least effective control technique for spiders because of the limited amount o. areas actually occupied by the spiders. However, large warehouses with high ceilings, certain crawlspaces or attics, or other situations where it is impossible to reach all areas can benefit from a space treatment. Correct calculation of the volume of the space and the required dosage is critical to a successful space treatment.</p>

<p><h6>Perimeter Treatments.</h6> Application of a residual insecticide to the building&#39;s foundation and the surrounding ground area may be beneficial for active hunter spiders and brown recluse spiders that generally enter buildings from ground level.</p>

<p><h6>Fumigation.</h6> In situations where brown recluse spider infestations are severe and extensive, tent fumigation may be attempted. This procedure may not always result in total elimination, however, and should be reserved for infestations that cannot be controlled utilizing other treatment strategies.</p>

<p><strong>MANAGING BROWN RECLUSE INFESTATIONS.</strong> Controlling brown recluse spiders is a time-consuming effort, but these extreme measures are often necessary because of the dangerous nature of this spider. Any treatment may result in spiders becoming more active, which may bring them into contact with people living or working within the building. For this reason, the customer should be advised concerning the practices that can help prevent bites. The generous use of monitoring traps will help catch and remove many of these spiders as they move about in response to treatment. Traps are also important for infestations of hobo spiders, particularly during the fall when the males are wandering in search of fe足males (Dale 2003).</p>

<p>
Once brown recluse spiders have been confirmed in a building, the extent of the infestation must be determined by inspection and monitoring traps. Infestations in older buildings that have a large spider population are often difficult to eliminate totally. In many cases the spiders recur periodically so continued inspection, monitoring, and treatments may be necessary. In severe cases involving older or large, complex buildings, fumigation of the structure has been completed, but even this step has failed to totally eliminate brown recluse spiders for long periods in some cases. A few pest control companies that specialize in known recluse spider control have developed a service agreement specifically for these spiders. This service agreement spells out the structure of the service and usually does totally guarantee prevention of bites.</p>

<p>
Hedges and Lacey (1995) recommended the following management guidelines for brown recluse spider infestations. Most of these are customer responsibilities.</p>

<p><h6>Practices to Avoid Possible Bites.</h6> Homeowners who have brown recluse spiders can practice certain habits to minimize possible bites until the infestation is effectively controlled. Because most bites occur when a spider is trapped against the skin inside clothing or shoes, clothing can be stored in sealed plastic bags inside drawers or inside plastic storage compartments hanging in closets. Shoes should be stored inside plastic shoe boxes. clothes left on the floor, in a clothing basket, or otherwise exposed should always be shaken well before wearing. Beds should be moved out so they do not touch walls or &#39;curtains. Bed skirts around the box springs of beds should be removed from beds and bedspreads that come near or touch the floor should not be used. People living in infested homes also should get into the habit of inspecting bedding prior to climbing under the covers.</p>

<p><h6>Harborage Removal.</h6> Long-term relief from brown recluse spiders demands the conditions contributing to an infestation be corrected or removed. Items lying on the ground, such as piles of lumber and other debris, should be removed from the property, Firewood piles should be moved as far from a home as possible, stored off the ground, and covered with plastic to keep it dry. Heavy vegetation, such as ivy and other ground covers, should be cut at least 18 inches away from the building foundation or, better yet, eliminated all together near the building. Poorly ventilated attics and small enclosed spaces above porches, carports, etc., should have proper ventilation. Indoors, clutter and stored items should be straightened or removed, especially stacks of papers, books, lumber, etc.</p>

<p><h6>Exclusion.</h6> Any crack in the exterior of a building through which spiders could enter should be sealed after it has first been treated with a residual dust product. It is especially important to seal the cracks under the eaves where the soffit meets the wall because this is where brown recluse spiders generally enter the attic. Foundation vents and soffit vents should be tight-fitting and equipped with screening. The weep holes brick veneer on structures cannot be sealed, but small pieces of screening can be inserted into the weep holes to exclude spiders and other pests. It is also important to seal cracks around pipes, wires, and cables leading up into the structure from the crawlspace or basement and down from the attic. Sealing cracks around ceiling vents and light fixtures is also necessary to prevent spiders from entering the living spaces below, where they can come into contact with homeowners.</p>

<p><h6>Boxes and Other Stored Items.</h6> When spiders are found living inside stored boxes, all boxes should be inspected for spiders by either the homeowner or the pest management professional. Leaving spiders untouched inside boxes allows a ready reinfestation source at the same house or new one when moving. Boxes may be moved from attics and basements to a garage or outside to be inspected. Any person moving or going through boxes should wear long sleeves and gloves to avoid accidental bites. A vacuum can be used to quickly remove spiders as they are encountered. After careful examination, the items may be replaced in the old, now spider free box or into a new box, then all corners and cracks of boxes taped to prevent spiders from re-entering.</p>

<p><h6>Vacuuming.</h6> The use of a vacuum device during the inspection is an effective and tine saving control measure when dealing with brown recluse spiders (and other spiders) b&#39; removing spiders and their webs and egg sacs as they are discovered. .</p>

<p><h6>Monitoring.</h6> Monitoring traps are first used in determining the presence and extent oft. infestation, then should be continuously used throughout the entire program. Not only, monitoring traps alert the service professional that spiders are still present or have reinfested, but each spider trapped is one that will not come into contact with anyone in the building and possibly bite them. The more traps used, the more spiders that will be trapped and removed. Traps may be placed along the wall under each piece of furniture behind the toilet, inside the sink vanity, inside and under kitchen cabinets, and in &quot; space below a bathtub, if accessible. In closets, traps may be placed at the floor level and possibly one or two on shelving. In basements and garages, traps may be locate along the floor behind stored items and also possibly on exposed sill plates. Numerous traps may also be placed in infested attics. Additional traps should be place where greater spider activity is noted.</p>

<p><strong>TYPES OF TREATMENTS.</strong> Pest management professionals can utilize a wide range of treatment techniques to control or reduce spider populations in an account.</p>

<p><h6>Crack and Void Treatments.</h6> Brown recluse spiders prefer to rest in cracks and voids and are secretive in their habits, so most of the applications will involve crack and void treatments, usually with a residual dust product. Cracks also can also be effectively treated with a residual aerosol product that provides quick knockdown and mortality of spiders.</p>

<p>All of the plates covering electric outlets and switches should be removed and the wall voids behind treated with a dust product. Brown recluse spiders often move From the attic down through the walls by following electrical wires. Be sure to equip :he duster with a plastic tip to avoid accidental shock. In severe infestations, wall voids may need to be drilled and treated just above the baseboard.</p>

<p>In crawlspaces and basements, it may be necessary to apply a residual dust into the cracks under sill plates and into the voids of foundation walls. This is particu足larly necessary for older buildings with stone or brick foundations. In attics, dust insecticides may need to be applied under insulation by lifting the insulation and applying a light amount of dust. This is time足 consuming work and is only necessary when spiders are found liv足ing under the insulation. Application of dust on top of the insula足tion generally does not provide sat足isfactory results. Some attics will have flooring placed on top of the attic joists to allow for attic storage, and this floor may need to be drilled to treat the voids underneath. An aerosol insecticide or a residual applied with an aerosol-generating machine may be needed to penetrate through insulation.</p>

<p><h6>Spot Treatments.</h6> Spot treatments alone will provide poor results and must be combined with other procedures. Such treatments should be directed to floor/wall junctures where these spiders are likely to crawl along walls behind furniture or items stored or placed against the walls. To crawlspaces and basements, spot treatments can be applied to the sill plate/box header area at the top of foundation walls and other sites where spiders might frequent.</p>

<p><h6>Direct Contact Treatments.</h6> Ultra-low-volume (ULV) space treatments are the least effective technique for brown recluse spiders, yet may be the one most frequently used. l&#39;his technique is best used for controlling flying insects, not for a pest like the brown recluse that hides in protected cracks and voids. Nonresidual ULV insecticides can be effectively used to control brown recluse spiders when applied as a directed contact treat足ment. This method is best used in cases where larger numbers of spiders are present and should be used in conjunction with other treatment techniques. The best results are achieved by directing the treatment at exposed spiders in attics and basements.</p>

<p><h6>Exterior Treatments.</h6> The most important control measure for outside areas is the removal of as many potential harborages as possible as discussed earlier in this section. This may automatically result in a reduc足tion of spiders near the building.</p>

<p>
Any crack in the exterior walls of the building should be treated with a residual dust insecticide and then sealed to prevent spiders from entering in the future. Sealing of cracks may be completed by the customer or by the professional, depending on the terms of the service agreement. Application of an appropriately labeled residual insecticide with an aerosol-generating machine, such as an Actisol&quot; or Micro-Injector,&quot; also can be used to treat the void behind brick veneer.</p>

<p>
A perimeter treatment may be applied to the foundation and ground away from the building. This treatment will have limited effectiveness for spiders and probably is only necessary for severe infestations with a high possibility for reinfestation from outside sources.</p>

<p><h6>MANAGING BLACK WIDOW SPIDER INFESTATIONS.</h6> Because of the dangerous nature of the black widow spider, rigorous control efforts are necessary when this spider is found inside a home or other building. Hedges and Lacey (1995) provide detailed guidelines for dealing with infestations of this spider.</p>

<p><h6>Sanitation.</h6> The most important item to address in reducing black widow infestations is the removal of potential hiding places outside the building, such as piles of lumber and other debris, stones, boards, etc. Firewood piles should be moved as far from a home as possible and stored off the ground and covered with plastic to keep it dry. Heavy vegeta足tion, such as ivy and other ground covers, should be cut away from the foundation. Tall grass should be kept cut low. It is also important to improve storage practices in garages, basements, and closets to limit the available harborages that can be used by black widow spiders. Items should be stored off the floor and away from walls and reduce as mud clutter as possible.</p>

<p><h6>Spider Removal.</h6> An important control technique that should be used for black widow spiders is vacuuming to immediately remove existing spiders, webs, and egg sacs as the) are discovered during the inspection. Black widow spiders are generally easy to fine because their webs will be found in accessible areas under furniture, in comers, and in, under, and among clutter and stored items. Removal of webs also makes it easier to determine if new activity is present during future inspections. When vacuuming black widow spiders, take care to remove the vacuum bag as soon as possible after finishing and empty it or seal it in a plastic bag before disposing in an outdoor trash receptacle.</p>

<p><h6>Exclusion and Lighting.</h6> Any crack in the exterior of a building through which spiders could enter should be sealed. Doors should have a tight-fitting weather strip on the bot足 tom and all vents should be equipped with tight-fitting screens. Exterior lighting should be changed to bulbs that attract fewer flying insects, thus reducing the amount of possible food available for spiders.</p>

<p><h6>Treatments.</h6> Insecticide applications following spider removal by vacuuming can help reduce or prevent new black widow infestations.</p>

<p><h6>Directed Contact Treatments.</h6> lf a vacuum device is not available to remove spiders, treatment of live, exposed spiders can be accomplished by directed contact treatment using a nonresidual aerosol insecticide.</p>

<p><h6>Dust Applications.</h6> In crawlspaces, it may be necessary to apply residual dust insecticides into comers, onto sill plate areas, and other areas where spiders are found. This applica足tion is necessary only in those cases where numerous spiders are present in the crawlspace. Dust is effective because it clings to the webs where the spider is more likely to contact it.</p>

<p><h6>Spot Treatments.</h6> The application of liquid residual wettable powder (WP) or microencapsulated (ME, CS) formulation to corners, behind and under furniture, behind stored items, and other likely web-building sites can be helpful in preventing new spiders from becoming established.</p>

<p><h6>Exterior Treatments.</h6> Exterior cracks in the exterior walls of the building should be treated with a residual dust and then sealed to prevent spiders from entering in the future. Sealing of cracks may be completed by the customer or by the professional, depending on the terms of the service agreement. Long-term control of black widow spider infestations is best achieved by reducing potential outdoor harborages and sealing cracks and holes through which they might enter. These steps result in a reduction of spiders and the in足 sects they prey upon near the building.</p>
