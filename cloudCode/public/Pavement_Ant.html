<h1>Pavement Ant</h1>
<h2>Tetramorium caespitum (Linnaeus)</h2>
<h2>Subfamily Myrmicinae</h2>

<p><strong>Identifying Characteristics.</strong> 
The workers are 2.5 to 3 mm long and monomophic (one size).  They
have two-segmented petiole, and a stinger.  It is not known, however,
if they can bite or sting (Thompson 1990).  Their antennae are
12-segmented with a three-segmented club.  The propodeum has a pair
of small spines.  The head and thorax are sculptured with numerous
parallel grooves.  The body color varies from light to dark brown to
blackish (Smith 1965).  Queens have similar appearance but are larger
(6 mm)(Thompson 1990).  Pavement ants move slowly.</p>

<p><strong>Distribution.</strong>
 Brown (1957) and Smith  (1965) believed this ant to be of European
or Asiatic origin, while Creighton (1950) considered it native to
North America.  Its range includes most of the U.S., and it is
particularly common along  the West Coast (Bennett et al 1997).  In
the Northeast and Midwest, it is the number one ant pest in
commercial buildings (Hedges 1997).</p>

<p><strong>Biology &amp; Habits.</strong>  The
pavement ant derives its name form its habit of nesting beside and
under sidewalks, driveways, and foundations.  New colonies are
established after mating flights that usually take place in the
spring but may occur at other times of the year if the ants are
nesting indoors (Hedges 1997).  The alates typically emerge from
under baseboards, expansion joints, or from floor registers connected
to heating ducts.  In commercial buildings, they often become a
nuisance when the alates emerge form openings in walls above false
ceiling, then drop into the rooms below (Hedges 1992).  This activity
may go on for weeks as more alates emerge.</p>

<p>Nests
are located in soil in the open or under stones and pavement, and in
masonry or rotting wood (Smith 1965).  The ants usually leave
conspicuous piles of excavated soil.  During winter, they will move
inside, preferably to be near to a heat source such as radiator or
heating duct (Hedges 1997).</p>

<p>Pavement
Ants tend homopterans for honeydew, especially subterranean forms,
and feed on live and dead insects and a variety of plants (Smith
1965).  As household pests, they are attracted to both greasy and
sweet foods (Bennett et al. 1997).</p>
