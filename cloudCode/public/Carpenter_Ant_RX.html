<p><h5>NOTE:  Pestec uses baits with liquid and granular formulations.  Technicians are permitted to use baits in bait stations at CCSF locations.  At locations other than CCSF baits can be used with dusts (as a last resort).  Under no circumstances are technicians permitted the use of spray insecticides for the control of ants.</h5><p>  

<p><strong>SPRAYS.</strong>  Non-repellent insecticides are effective as perimeter treatments when applied to the exterior foundation, around door and window frames and under the lower edge of siding (Hansen 1989).   Trails should also be treated when they can be located.  In locations prone to infestation (e.g. wooded lots), a perimeter treatment may be applied biannually, or at least in the spring, when the carpenter ants become active.  These same insecticides can be used to treat around tree trunks harboring carpenter ants, as well as any nests that may be found inside a tree.  These materials are effective at low concentrations and are readily transferred to other ants, thereby reducing the total population.  Perimeter treatments with nonrepellent insecticides are especially effective when satellite nests are indoors and the parent nest is outdoors.  The interchange of ants between the nests spreads the active ingredient to the entire colony.  Such treatments, however, usually do not result in total control of an infestation.  Location and treatment of the parent colony should be the goal, with perimeter treatment assisting in reducing ant activity inside the building.<p>

<p><strong>DUSTS.</strong>  For nests found in structural voids or inside wood timbers, a dust formulation can be applied in very light, thin layers.  Dusts become repellent when applied too heavily.  Compressed-air or cordless electric dusters are helpful in treating wall voids because of their very light output and excellent coverage (Akre et al. 1995). Dusts can be injected into wall voids either through existing openings around plumbing and electrical lines or by drilling access holes.<p>

<p><strong>BAITS.</strong>  Carpenter ants forage on the ground and in trees and other vegetation for insects and honeydew.  Therefore, baits should be applied outside, along foraging trails.  A variety of baits should be offered to the ants to determine their preference.  Baiting is most effective during the foraging season and requires monitoring to determine bait acceptance, amount consumed, and reduction in the ant population (Hansen 2000).  Baiting is often slower in achieving results than residual treatments but may be preferred by clients and is important to reach those colonies that may be out of reach for treatment, such as trees or on a neighboring property.<p>

In an initial treatment for carpenter ants, the professional may drill and remove switch plates to apply dust into wall voids and also may apply a perimeter treatment outside (Akre et al. 1995).  If baits are used in combination with residual treatments, the baits should be applied first, permitting ants several days to feed on them so the active ingredient can be distributed through the colony.<p>
