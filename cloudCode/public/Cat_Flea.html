<h1>Cat Flea</h1>
<h2>(Ctenocephalides felis)</h2>

<p><strong>Background Information. </strong> There
are at least 2,500 species of fleas worldwide. Fleas are the main
source of transmission of the plague, although it is most commonly
found in the Ground Squirrel Flea and the Oriental Rat Flea. The
plague, known as the black death, killed between one quarter to one
third of Europe during the middle ages, and is still known to cause
approximately a dozen deaths in the United States each year. 90% of
the fleas found on cats and dogs in North America are cat fleas. 
</p>

<p><strong>Distribution &amp; Habitat.</strong> 
Adult fleas use tarsal hooks to attach to their host animal, commonly
a cat or dog. Fleas are found on or near the bedding area of the host
animal. 
</p>

<p><strong>Identification.</strong>
 Adult cat fleas are 1-2 mm in length and typically reddish brown to
black in color. 
</p>

<p><strong>Life Cycle.</strong> 36-48 hour
after females have a blood meal, they will then lay approximately 10
eggs, each 1/50 inch long and white in color. The eggs are not sticky
and typically fall through the host’s coat. They will hatch out
into larva in typically 2-10 days. Larva go through three instars,
during which they will eat any available organic material. Larvae
will eat the fecal matter of adults, also known as “flea dirt”.
The larval stage goes from 3 weeks to 3 months, depending on
environmental conditions.  Fleas then form a cocoon to become a pupa,
a phase that can last as little as a week or several months if they
need to overwinter. The silk the cocoon is made of is sticky and
attracts debris or dirt so it camouflages in the environment. The
cocoons must be stimulated through the presence of a host via
movement, heat or carbon dioxide before they can emerge as adults.
From egg to adult can happen in as little as 12 days or up to several
months. Adult fleas can live up to a year when feeding on regular
meals. 
</p>

<p><strong>Feeding Behavior.</strong> Fleas
feed on the blood of warm blooded animals. Their primary hosts are
cats, although they will feed on dogs, humans and mammals and birds.
Cat fleas typically need their host animal, usually dog or cat, to
complete their lifecycle, but females can produce eggs off human
blood if given consistent access to a food source. A female flea can
consume up to 15 times her body weight each day. 
</p>

<p><strong>Health Concerns.</strong> Fleas
are known to transmit several different diseases. Cat fleas have been
found to carry typhus and tapeworms. The bites of fleas can also be
extremely itchy and painful to the host animal.
