<h1>Management of Earwigs</h1>

"A great deal of the management efforts directed at earwig infestations involve nonchemical means followed by the application of insecticides to specific active harborages.  If the conditions supporting the infestation are not addressed, complete relief from the infestation is not likely to be realized.<p>

<strong>Physical Removal.</strong>  In larger infestations, vacuums are useful for removing large numbers of earwigs found in harborages outdoors as well as indoors.  If items stored outside are infested with earwigs,  these items may be shaken to dislodge the insects, which can then be removed by vacuuming.<p>

<strong>Harborage Removal.</strong>  Unfortunately, the habitat that is created and is desired by suburbanites featuring landscaping, mulches, ornamental rocks, patio stones, picnic furniture, decks, etc., is also conducive to earwig populations the elimination of outdoor harborages used by earwigs, which as piles of lumber, bricks and other items, is key to long term control.  Elimination of heavy ground covering vegetation near buildings is recommended.  Tree and shrub limbs should be trimmed away from walls and the roof.  Critters need to be kept clear of leaves and other debris.<p>

<strong>Excess Moisture.</strong>  Moisture management is also highly important.  Good drainage and grading and proper direction of irrigation sprinklers minimizes moisture beside the foundation.  Early morning watering allows the vegetation to dry during the day rather than remain wet throughout the night.  Crawlspaces and attics should be properly ventilated.  Crawlspaces also may need vapor barriers, fans, or sump pumps to sufficiently reduce high humidity and water.<p>

<strong>Modification of Exterior Lighting.</strong>  The striped earwig, and sometimes the European earwig, will be attracted to exterior lights, so the use of sodium exterior lights or yellow "bug light" bulbs on the outside of buildings will greatly reduce the numbers of these earwigs attracted to a structure.<p>

<strong>Exclusion.</strong>  Access into the structure can be reduced by caulking of cracks and crevices and the installation of weather stripping around windows and doors.  Foundation and attic vents should be equipped with tight-fitting insect screens.<p>

<strong>Traps.</strong>  Traps made of bamboo or rolled newspaper take advantage of the earwig's propensity to crawl into cracks and crevices.  Traps should be placed out prior to dark and checked the following morning.  Earwigs that are trapped can be shaken into a pail of soapy water.  Grooved board traps set in shrubbery, hedges, and around trees, as described by Morris (1965), have been used to effectively reduce European earwig populations.  Sticky monitoring traps can also be used to detect and monitor the distribution of earwigs inside.<p>

<strong>Treatments.</strong>  The application of insecticides to control earwigs generally should be undertaken after or in combination with addressing the conditions contributing to the infestation.  The best results are achieved when treatments are directed at active harborages discovered during the inspection.<p>

Historically, baits used around the exterior of structures have played a major role in the control of earwigs.  Today, few effective baits are available that are labeled for such use.  As a result, control of earwigs using insecticide is largely accomplished through the use of perimeter treatments.  A wide variety of current insecticides list earwigs on the label, both for interior and exterior use.  Wettable powder or microencapsulated insecticides are the most appropriate formulations should be used to treat inside cracks, holes, and voids in the building's exterior where earwigs may be hiding, and sealing these openings following treatment is recommended.<p>

Special attention should be paid to the areas most frequented by earwigs.  In addition to the building foundations, piles of wood and stones, wooden fences, tree holes, the underside of decks, sheds, landscape timbers, and dog houses are likely harborages.  The European earwig's preference for cracks inside and out is similar to that of the German cockroach indoors; therefore, cracks and crevice treatments are the primary treatment technique to employ.<p>
