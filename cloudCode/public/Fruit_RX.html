<h1>CONTROL OF SMALL FLIES IN STRUCTURES</h1>

<p>
"The key to solving infestations of small flies such as fruit flies or phorid flies, is to find a  of the breeding sources and correct or eliminate them. Insecticide treatments are rarel  needed for these flies except for space treatments to kill remaining adult flies after breeding sources have been removed. Infestations of these flies persist because one or more breeding sources have been overlooked. Because these flies can develop in large numbers from a very small amount of decaying organic matter, this task can be very difficult.  Although a bakery was thoroughly washed each night, flour and moisture collected in cracks under the edge of kitchen equipment at the floor level. Phorid flies were breeding in these cracks by the hundreds. Only by scraping out the fermenting flour, scrubbing the cracks with soap and water, and drying the area with an air compressor was the problem solved (Hedges 1994). The cracks were sealed with a durable caulk to prevent flour from collecting in these areas again.

<p><strong>FRUIT FLIES. </strong> In restaurants, the source offruit fly infestations is often some rotting fruits or vegetable that was carelessly swept beneath a counter or similar place or boxes of stacked produce that were overlooked on a bottom shelf. Miller (1946) found the source of an infestation in a restaurant to be the partially empty tomato catsup bottles stored in the basement. Opened jars of fruits and vegetables should be kept in the icebox or refrigerator.</p>

<p>Hedges (1994) noted that a source for fruit flies in restaurants is trash containers place in recessed or out-of-the-way areas that are not emptied or cleaned regularly. It is common to find fruit flies breeding in or under Dumpsters and then making their way into the building. Boxes or containers of aluminum cans awaiting recycling can be a source of fruit flies. Ehmann found fruit flies infesting cut limes, lemons, and bananas (used for exotic drinks) that have slipped into cracks and voids behind liquor bars.</p>

<p>Gross (1948) made the following observations regarding the breeding sites of Drosphila in buildings: &quot;Fermenting fruits, vegetables, or juices are the most obvious sourc­es of breeding. But repeatedly we find heavy infestations where there are no such violations of sanitation, not even one rotting potato in the bottom of the bin or lost under the fountain. What then? Dishwater from sinks, drain water from refrigerators or iceboxes. ar the slop water from floor scrubbings are saturated with food particles. Under the prop conditions, they become fermented and make the ideal breeding place for the fruit, vinegartly. One foul, soured mop can breed many thousands. The same is true of brooms, rags, or paper. Garbage-laden water from sinks, coolers and iceboxes often clogs a floor drain and spreads over the floor. There, it forms a thin, sour, gelatinous layer, paradise for the fruit fly. When kitchen floors are scrubbed or mopped, the slop seeps into crevices, under the mold boards and other hidden places. There, it quickly ferments into a perfect soup for the flies.&#39;</p>


<p>Ditman et al. (1936) recommended canning plants be protected from these flies by the removal of debris, peelings, decaying fruit, etc., and that floors should be thoroughly cleaned and washed daily. Bickley et al. (1956) commented that most of the adult fruit flies in factories are carried in from the field.</p>

<p>
The Woodstream Corp. makes a plastic, I-quart jar trap, called the Victor Flying Insect Trap, that is valuable in deter­ mining the presence of fruit flies. BioLogic makes a trap specifically designed for capturing fruit flies called the Natural Catch Fly Trap. As of this writing (2003), manufac­turers, such as Whitmire Micro-Gen (St. Louis, Mo.) and Rockwell Laboratories (Minneapolis, Minn.), are developing or have developed fruit fly attractants that can be used in a variety of traps. Wood stream Corp. is also developing a small, disposable light trap designed for fruit flies. Such traps may be arrayed uniformly throughout an infested area. Typically, the traps capturing the most flies are those closest to a breed­ ing source.</p>

Air movement should be used whenever possible. At night, after the facility is shut down, oscillating pedestal fans and box fans will keep small flies from landing and laying eggs onto items and will help dry out liquids. The author reports immediate cessation of flying Drosophila in fruit storage areas with one large pedestal fan that oscillates directed at boxes of fruit. In addition, employees enjoy the cool circu­ lation of the air during hot summer months.</p>

<p>
Bacterial products designed for drain cleaning may also be labeled for application, by spraying, to wet or damp areas where organic mat­ter might accumulate and prove dif­ficult to clean. Regular application of such products to critical areas has shown the ability to reduce the pres­ence of fruit flies and similar flies such as phorid flies in a variety of structures."</p>
