<h1>The House Mouse</h1>
<h2>(Mus musculus)</h2>


<p>

<p><strong>Background Information.</strong>  The house mouse has been known to cohabitate with humans as far back as 12,000 years ago.  The house mouse is a wild species, but they have also been domesticated for as pet mice and use in laboratory testing. Aside from humans, they are considered the most studied mammal. Because of cross breeding, there are several species and subspecies of the house mouse recognized. The house mouse is considered the worst rodent pest in most parts of the world.<p> 
<p><strong>Distribution &amp; Habitat</strong>  The house mouse is found worldwide, from the tropics to arctic and antarctic climates.  House mice are both urban pests that invade structures, but are also can be found around farms, in fields, and other outdoor spaces.<p> 
House mice are adverse to bright lights, and harbor in various hidden spaces. They create nests out of soft and fibrous material like paper or burlap. Nests are usually in a ball shape about 4 to 6 inches in diameter.<p> 
Community nests with multiple females and their offspring can be found in certain environments. The presence of these communities as well as the size of territories and aggression levels due to protecting these territories are based on the amount of local resources.<p> 
<p><strong>Identification</strong>  Adult house mice range from 4 to 8 inches in length, including a semi-naked tail that is typically the same length as the body and head. They range in color from light brown to nearly all black. House mice typically range from about 0.5 to 1 ounce.<p> 
While similar in size and shape to young rats, mice have feet and ears proportional to their body size.<p> 
<p><strong>Life cycle</strong>	In the wild, house mice are seasonal breeders, with peak production occurring in summer and fall. In temperature regulated environments, like inside homes and other structures, breeding can occur year round.<p> 
The house mouse gestational period averages 18 to 21 days. Females can produce litters every 30 to 50 days. Litters range from 2 to 13 mice, with an average of 5 to 6 mice per litter. There are an equal number of males to females in each litter. In populations reared outdoors and/or in colder temperatures smaller young and fewer mice per litter typically are produced. Females can produce up to 42 to 60 offspring a year. The newborn mice range from 0.02 to 0.03 ounces and are blind, pink and hairless. After about 3 weeks the mice have a full coat and begin eating solid food. House mice are sexually mature at 6 to 10 weeks of age.<p> 
Lifespan is dependent on several factors including predation, access to food, and exposure to harsh environmental conditions. The average lifespan of the house mouse is a few months to a year, but can average 1-2 years in sheltered environments.<p> 
<p><strong>Feeding behavior</strong>  The house mouse is typically nocturnal, although seeing them during the day does not necessarily indicate a large population. Mice leave the nest for food and water, but rarely travel more than 10 to 30 feet away. The house mouse in omnivorous, feeding primarily on seeds and grain but also preferring food that is high in protein.<p> 
Mice are often found to make several short trips throughout their territories, eating a small amount of food during each trip. They eat an average about 10 to 20 mg of food per day. If water is readily available, they will consume 1 to 2 cc per day, but if water is not available they will get the water they need from the food they consume.<p> 
<p><strong>Health Concerns</strong>  Aside from property damage, mice can contaminate food as well as spread diseases or parasites. These can include salmonellosis, rickett-sialpox, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, leptospirosis, ratbite fever, tapeworms, and ringworm.<p>
