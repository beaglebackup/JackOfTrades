<h1><strong>Application of Baits.</strong> Although
ant baits have had a long history in pest control, there is renewed
interest in their development and use.  This new popularity is due to
public pressure to reduce pesticide use, new insecticides well-suited
for bait formulation, and the numerous advantages of using baits: (1)
baits are more target specific than contact insecticides; (2) baits
are more cost-effective compared than labor-intensive inspections to
locate nests (which are often unsuccessful) and treatment strategies
that involve invasive techniques like drilling and dusting; and (3)
baits can be used in sensitive places such as commercial kitchens and
food preparation areas, and around electrical equipment.  On the
negative side, baits tend to be slower acting than sprays or dusts. 
Therefore, the professional needs to educate a client about how baits
work and the amount of time it takes to obtain control with them.</p>
<p><strong>Bait formulation And Composition. </strong>
Baits are formulated as liquids, discrete solid matrices (including
gels), and granules (Silverman and Roulston 2003).  Liquid is an
ideal formulation for many pest ants that have coevolved with
honeydew-producing insects.  A bait must attract ants and be
palatable, so that it is consumed and shared with other ants.  Other
materials added to the bait, such as emulsifiers, preservatives, and
waterproofing or antimicrobial agents must also be palatable.  The
toxicant must have delayed activity to ensure a widespread
distribution in the colony.  If it is too fast acting, recruitment
and trophallaxis will break down and the active ingredient will not
be sufficiently transferred (Rust et al 2002).</p>
<p>Insect
growth regulators (IGRs) and metabolic inhibitors are two frequently
used bait toxicants.  IGRs work slowly, interfering with larval
development, caste differentiation, and reproduction of the queen. 
Compared with IGRs, metabolic inhibitors work relatively fast by
interfering with cellular respiration.</p>
