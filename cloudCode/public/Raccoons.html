<h1>Raccoons</h1>
<h2>Class Mammalia, Order Carnivora, Fmily Procyonidae</h2>
<p>
“Even though they are normally
easily frightened from one’s garden, raccoons can be fierce
fighters when cornered in such instances, they have been known to
inflict fatal wounds on even relatively large dogs.  Raccoons, like
skunks and armadillos, can be destructive to lawns and other grounds
landscaped in cultured turfgrass due to a propensity for “Grubbing”
behavior, as they dig for scarab beetle larvae on which to feed. 
Multiple, large areas of sod in a lawn can be torn up overnight as a
result of raccoon grubbing.</p>

<p>Raccoons
often gain access into attics, basements, and crawlspaces by forcing
open loose or broken vent covers, louvers, windows, and carpentry. 
Female raccoons readily invade attics or enter uncapped chimney flues
and occupy the smoke shelf above the damper door to birth and wean
their litters of pups.  Since raccoons often are infested with ticks
and various fleas, including cat fleas, human occupants and their
companion animals are readily infested secondarily by the
introduction of these ectoparasites via fireplace hearths and attic
entrances.  Raccoon feces accumulate in the above-mentioned areas,
thereby giving rise to odor and secondary pest problems, as well as
serving as a potential source of raccoon roundworm infection. 
Raccoons have been implicated in several other infectious diseases
transmissible to humans including leptospirosis, Chagas disease,
tularemia and, most notably, rabies.

<p>Besides
invading human dwellings and commercial buildings, raccoons also take
up residence in barns, stables, and various outbuildings.”</p>
