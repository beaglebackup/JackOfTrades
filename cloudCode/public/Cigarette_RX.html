<p><strong>CONTROL.</strong> "In homes, the focus will be on finding and discarding infested material.  It is particularly important to check spices, pet food, and old rodent bait.  In some parts of the country, particulary the South and Southeast, cigarette beetles may fly to homes from nearby warehouses and cause reinfestation.  In storage areas, residual insecticides can be applied to crevices and shelves after the removal of food products to help prevent reinfestation of new materials.</p>

<p>Currently, methyl bromide and phosphine are the most commonly used fumigants.  Fumigation with a combination of heat, phosphine, and carbon dioxiade shows great promise against strored product insects.  Space treatments may help control exposed insects, although some evidence exists of resistance to pyrethrins.  Apllications of pyrethrum between 6:00 p.m. and midnight generally coincides with the greatest activity of cigarette beetles and helps in achieving control.  More recently, the uses of insect growth regulators, such as methoprene and hydro prene has achieved good results against the cigarette beetle."</p>
