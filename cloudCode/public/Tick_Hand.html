<p><strong>Avoiding tick bites.</strong>  "The best way to avoid contracting tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme Disease is to avoid tick bites.  Avoiding tick infested areas is the best approach, but if venturing into such areas, precautions should be taken.  Long-sleeved shirts and long pants are a must when working or walking in tick-infested areas.  Light-colored clothing should be worn to make ticks easier to see, and pants should be tucked into socks or boots to prevent ticks from crawling under pant legs.  Leggings may also be worn.  Long hair should be tucked up under a hat.  Tick repellants can be applied to the outside of clothing, particularly the pants legs.<p>

After exiting infested areas, a visual body inspection should be made for ticks, and when working or walking in tick country, it is a good idea to conduct these examinations at least once a day.  A favorite feeding site of ticks on human beings is at the base of the skull where long hair can hide the tick, so a partner should inspect the backside and back of head.  Remember, larval and nymphal stages of ticks are very small and could be overlooked as freckles.  Clothing also should be washed immediately in warm water and detergent.  Never throw such clothing in a hamper with other clothes or onto the floor.  Pets need to be protected by preventing them from venturing into tick-infested areas."<p>
