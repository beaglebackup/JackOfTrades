<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“Blow
flies and bottle flies are the common, medium-sized flies with a
metallic blue, green, bronze, or black sheen that may produce an
audible buzzing sound, especially when flying around windows.  The
blow flies are primarily scavengers and deposit their eggs on both
fresh and decaying meat and fish, on dead animals, in garbage and in
fecal material.  Entomologists at the USDA in Savannah, Ga., showed
the stools of dogs were an important breeding site of blow flies.  At
times, the eggs may be oviposited in wounds of animals and people; a
condition known as myiasis.  Norris (1965) reviewed the biology of
blow flies in detail.</p>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The
two common bluebottle flies are Calliphora vomitoria (L.) and
Calliphora vicina R.D., (formerly erythocephala([Meig.]).  These
flies are about 1/5 inch (10 mm) long and have a metallic blue
abdomen.  The two common green bottle flies, Lucilia Caesar (L.) and
Phaenicia sericata (Meig.)(formerly Lucilia), are a metallic
blue-green color.  Dodge (1954) prepared a key to these and other
common flies.  Richardson (1936) stated C. vicina appears in Iowa
during the latter part of March and is not seen after December 1. 
The winter is passed in the larval, pupal, and adult stages.  Hagmann
and Barber (1948) and Green (1951) noted the larvae of Phaenicia
sericata hibernate in the soil of New Jersey and pupate a short while
before emerging.  Cyanomyia cadaverina (Desv.) has similar habits to
those of the blue bottle flies, and in Iowa it is most common in the
spring and autumn.</p>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Richardson
(1936) found Phormia regina, the black blow fly, to be one of the
most common blowflies in Iowa.  He noted it is “present throughout
the summer and venturing outdoors on warm days during the winter.  It
is slightly more robust in appearance than the green bottle fly and
darker in color, being dark metallic on the thorax and abdomen.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The
black blow fly will sometimes enter the house to lay its eggs on meat
and fish or to feed upon milk and table refuse.  It breeds in
garbage, animal carcasses, and offal.  Complete development requires
from about 10 days to more than three weeks.  Dicke and Eastwood
(1952) found this species to be the most common blow fly in Madison.

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Where
blow flies and bottle flies occur in unusual numbers in the home,
they may be breeding either in the house proper or in the immediate
vicinity, although Lindquist et al. (1951) captured P. sericata as
far as 4 miles (6.4 km) from the point of release.</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Davis
(1944) recorded the occurrence of Phaenicia all through a house due
to the presence of dead birds in a register in the ceiling used for
ventilation purposes.  In 1953, the same author found dead birds in
the chimney responsible for maggots throughout the home.  Morse
(1911) found the larvae migrating over Oriental rugs, the source of
the infestation being a dead squirrel in the chimney.  Griswold
(1942) noted the presence of a large number of maggots of a green
bottle fly in the bedroom where they fell from the ceiling onto a
bed, and, at a later date, adult flies were present in this room. 
Although the source of infestation was not found, she noted: “It
seems probable, however, that the maggots were feeding on a mouse or
a squirrel that had died in the space between ceiling of the bedroom
and the floor of the room above.”</p>
