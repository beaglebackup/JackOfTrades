<h1>Skunks</h1>
<h2>Class Mammalia, Order Carnivora, Family Mustelidae</h2>
<p>

"Skunk activity around buildings may go unnoticed for awhile until one take up occupancy beneath a porch, deck, slab foundation, or outbuilding floor or has a confrontation with another animal, such as a dog, leaving the offensive scent as an indicator of its presence or reminder of an encounter with someone's canine companion.  A faint lingering skunk odor is occasionally detected where skunks have fed or traveled, even though the animals have not scent-sprayed the area.  Female skunks often have their springtime litters within the cavities they excavate beneath porches, decks, and buildings.<p>

Lawns infested with scarab beetle larvae are subject to grubbing behavior by skunks (as well as raccoons and armadillos) that readily feed on these insects.  The resulting damage to sod certainly contributes to the skunk's status as an urban pest.<p>

Skunks have been found infected with an array of diseases that may or may not affect humans, including histeriosis, mastitis, distemper, Q fever, histoplasmosis, microfilaria, and by far the most important, rabies.  As with porcupines, skunks are also an attractive nuisance to dogs.  The inexperience, and even experience, dog will investigate the trail of a skunk.  The dog nearly always comes out the loser in these encounters.  When the dog tangles with a skunk in the woods away from home, the only concern is decontaminating the dog; but if that occurs under a porch or patio deck, the decontamination problem is substantially greater.

<p><strong>Odor control.</strong>  A variety of commercially availabel odor neutralizer products (e.g., neutroleup-alpha, Epoleon, Liquizyme) are available for the professional to use for neutralizing skunk scent on clothing, equipment, vehicle interiors, customers' personal property, and dogs."<p>
