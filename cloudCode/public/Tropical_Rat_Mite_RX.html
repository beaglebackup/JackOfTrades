<p><strong>Treatment</strong>
<h4>Inspection.</h4>
<ul>  
<li>Inspect rodent prone areas such as attics and crawl spaces for rodent activity.</li>
<li>Inspect insulation in attics for rodent nest sites and tunnel/ runways</li>
<li>Inspect for rodent burrow in the soil of crawl spaces and inspect for damaged overhead rolled insulation</li>
<li>Inspect around hot water pipes and on top of heater ducting for rodent nest</li> 
<li>Inspect baseboards and around electrical plates for Mites.</li> 
<li>Inspect around wall mounted heaters, stoves and wet walls.</li><p>
</ul>
<h4>Monitoring.</h4>
Customer evaluation Question: Does the customer experience more or less bites after treatments have been performed?<p>
Evaluate rodent management program: Has rodent trapping and exclusion been successful?<p> 
Monitors can be useful for collecting samples<P> 
<h4>Prevention.</h4>
Review rodent exclusion for rodents.<p> 
<h4>Treatment.</h4>
Mechanical &amp; physical control :<br><ul>
<li>Sticky traps</li>
<li>vacuum cleaner</li>
<li>Steam cleaner</li><p>
</ul>

Chemical Control:<br>
Use insecticidal dust with silica aerogel or pyrethrins  in rodent dens within blown insulation or blown into rodent dens in soil burrows.  Increased efficacy of insecticidal dust in attic spaces will occur when blown in insulation is fluffed up as dust is being applied. Start at the furthest end of the attic and work backwards toward the entrances hatch. Disrupt settled insulation to expose buried rodent nest and runways to insecticidal dust .  Be sure to dust rodent dens, runways, around pipes, wall voids, can light fixtures and electrical lines were a source of heat may be present.<p> 

If attic has rolled out insulations inspect for rodent burrows within. Look for holes entering the sides or edges of the rolled insulations. If a burrow is found pull apart the top layer of insulation to expose the burrow and nest site within . Dust rodents den, runway and top layer of exposed insulation also keep in mind heat sources.<p> 

In crawl spaces inspect for rodent burrows and feeding sites in the soil , on top of hvac and ducting systems, in pockets underneath bathtubs and if installed rolled insulation on the subfloor. Blow dust into burrows made into the soil and insulation. Dust pockets near bathtubs, and around any pipe fixture  or electrical lines leading into building. It may not be necessary to dust entire crawl space.<p> 

Dust in wall void where mites can enter the building.  Dust behind electrical outlets, water pipes, cracks and crevices and cracks underneath baseboards.<p>
