<h2>ILLUSIONS OF PARASITOSIS</h2></p>

<p>
"A number of causes of skin irritation may be involved when people say insects or arachnids are infesting their bodies. One or more of the following could be involved:</p>


1.) 
Allergic dermatitis such as eczema, contact dermatitis, and urticaria can cause itching. Persons with cutaneous allergies can react to even minute amounts of allergen (Katz 1982).
<p>
2.) Cutaneous sensitizers do not cause an immediate reaction on the first contact, but after several days of continuous contact, dermatitis may appear. As well as directly wounding the skin, sensitizers cause the body&#39;s immune system to respond. Some people will be affected and some will not. Examples include certain aniline dyes, chromium, waxes, poisonous plants, and plastics (such as uncured epoxy resins), acryl­ics, and urea and phenol formaldehyde.</p>


3.) 
Temperature changes seem to make skin more sensitive, including seasonal changes that occur in spring and autumn, and environmental changes, such as going from an air-conditioned room to the outdoors (Anonymous 1981).
4.) 
Dry skin is more sensitive to many of the factors on this list, which can increase chances of skin irritation. In winter, overheated rooms with low humidity cause skin to lose moisture, become dry, and itch (Caruba 1983).

5.) 
Static electricity is prevalent in low-humidity environments. In a room with low humidity and new carpets, carpet fibers cover shoes and static electricity may attract other minute materials (Blum 1986).

6.) 
A report from the Michigan Department of Public Health documented how inanimate particles such as dust, paper particles, and other small particles can &quot;bite&quot; people. Particles may accumulate through inefficient housekeeping and are made mobile through the movement of people, fans on office equipment such as personal computers and copy machines, static electricity, and healing/air-conditioning systems. Particles are attracted to people and adhere to the skin by polar electricity. Particles may puncture skin through abrasion of clothing, furniture, etc., causing a bite-like sore (Pennington and Rothchild 1987).

7.) 
&quot;Tight building syndrome&quot; can be an issue as well. In a typical American home, approximately one air change per hour occurs. In a well-insulated house, there may only be one air change every five to 10 hours. Up to 50% of heated air and 90% 01 air conditioned air is recirculated, resulting in stale air having 10 times the concentrations of contaminants compared to fresh air. Various contaminants, such as those mentioned in this section, can cause skin irritations and contact dermatitis (Caruba 1983; Anonymous 1985; Lanson 1986).

8.) 
When we think of air pollution, we usually think of heavy automobile traffic and billowing smokestacks. But recent studies have shown that indoor air is frequently dirtier than outdoor air, sometimes exceeding permissible outdoor standards. In some cases, the indoor concentrations were 20 times greater than those outdoors (American Lung Association 1986b). The major source of higher contaminant levels are probably consumer products, and typical sources of chemical pollutants include fresh paint and propellants used in aerosols. On pesticide labels, &quot;inert ingredients:&quot; which are identified on the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) forms, may be considered a part of indoor air pollution. (Carey 1985).
<p>
9.) Sun-bathing may make the skin more sensitive to other factors.</p>

<p>
10.) Cosmetics cause a small but significant portion of contact dermatitis cases. In a patch test conducted by the North American Contact Dermatitis Group, 5.4% of people tested were identified as having reactions to cosmetics. People with all types of skin can suffer irritant and allergic cosmetic reactions (Engasser and Maibach 1986). Many &quot;skin care&quot; products are creams containing preservatives, emulsifiers, and lanolin that may cause allergic reactions. Eye shadow, mascara, bath soaps, and shampoos sometimes cause skin irritation as well. Hair dyes can cause allergic contact dermatitis. Deodorants, antiperspirants, moisturizers, and permanent wave products can cause both skin irritation and allergic con­tact dermatitis (Engasser and Maibach 1986).</p>

<p>
11.) Perfumes and other fragrance materials commonly cause allergic contact dermatitis. Occasionally, photodermatitis, contact urticaria, irritation, and depigmentation will also occur. A typical perfume may be made up of 10 to 300 separate components of more than 5,000 fragrance materials in use today (Larson 1986). Fragrances are not only found in cosmetics but also in such products as detergents, fabric softeners, toothpastes, and sanitary pads (Larson 1986). A fragrance commonly used in aftershave lotions, musk ambrette, is a photoallergen and a probable cause of persistent light eruptions in men (Engasser and Maibach 1986).</p>

<p>
12.) Detergents with enzymes may cause skin irritations (Consumer Reports L986). Some soaps (personal, laundry, or household) can produce an allergic reaction.</p>

<p>
13.) Warmer weather prompts people to wear less clothing and thus expose more skin to potential irritants. Woolen or mohair fabric will also produce nonspecific irritations, Fibers, rubber, dyes and mordants, fabric finishes, and cleaning solutions may produce clothing dermatitis. Untreated natural and synthetic fabrics and fibers are rarely the cause of skin problems (Blum 1986; Parker 1983; Storrs 1986).</p>

<p>
14.) Fibers from synthetic carpet &quot;leap&quot; onto the static electricity-charged Legs of&quot; office workers, giving an illusion of &quot;bug bites&quot; (Caruba 1983).</p>

15.) Dirty carpets or draperies have dust and other particles that can cause skin irritations. These particles can be released through static electricity or when these items are handled, particularly when removed for cleaning,</p>

<p>
16.) Carpet cleaning shampoos that have not been thoroughly removed may cause skin irritations, especially on crawling infants.</p>

<p>
17.) New filters in heating or air-conditioning systems can release fiber particles causing &quot;bites&quot; or itching.</p>

<p>
18.) Old filters that need to be replaced can recycle collected dust particles.</p>

<p>
19.) Humans emit at least 15 different kinds of bioeffluents. People are a prime source of indoor air pollution, from the gases they release to the tobacco they smoke (Anonymous 1985).</p>

<p>
20.) Excess sweating may often damage skin to such an extent that it becomes more vulnerable to attack by external irritants. Some substances, such as caustics and soda ash, become irritants only when put into solution, such as when combined with excess sweat. Normal sweating produces a protective coating (Anonymous 1981).</p>

<p>
21.) Building materials may emit more than 200 odorous compounds (Anonymous 1985).</p> 

22.) Air sources for ventilation can be polluted and/or contaminated. Outside air intakes may be located near a potential source for contaminants.</p>

<p>
23.) Tobacco smoke contains approximately 3,800 chemical compounds, including particulates, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide (Reasor 1987).</p>

<p>
24.) Formaldehyde is a natural substance used in more than 3,000 different building products, including insulation, plywood, particle board, carpeting, and draperies (American Lung Association 1986a). It is a cause of breathing difficulties and skin irritation to people hypersensitive to this gas at concentrations lower than I part per million. Persistent cold symptoms, such as coughing and runny nose and eyes, may be reactions to formaldehyde gases (Lanson 1986; Albert 1987).</p>

<p>
25.) Chemical resins in the form of adhesives and wood preservatives may contribute to indoor air pollution (Anonymous 1985).</p>

<p>
26.) The condition of &quot;cable mites&quot; is not related to mites at all. It is actually a skin irritation caused by splinters from fabric-covered wires or cables. This condition was quite prevalent in the days of switchboard operators, and complaints of &quot;cable mites&quot; still occur in spite of today&#39;s high-tech telecommunication systems with buttons instead of cables (Ebeling 1978).</p>

<p>
27.) &quot;Paper or computer mites&quot; are a nonexistent arthropod scapegoat (similar to &quot;cable mites&quot;) for a skin irritation caused by a physical contaminant. Skin eruptions may result from paper &quot;splinters&quot; contacted when handling paper. Continuous-form paper for computer printers produces tiny paper splinters that can cause bite-like sores, rashes or itching).</p>

<p>
28.) Carbonless paper multi-part forms have caused skin irritation and even hives in people.</p>

<p>
29.) Pollen can cause hay fever symptoms and/or itching and bite-like sores. In a case where a woman complained of &quot;bites&quot; on her arms and chest, it was shown that she actually had a dermal reaction to Bermudagrass pollen grains (Howell 1961).</p>

<p>
30.) Poison ivy, poison oak, and other members of Rhus plants are, according to Dr. William Epstein, research dermatologist at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco, &quot;by far the major cause of allergic contact dermatitis in the United States&quot; (Vietmeyer 1985). It is estimated that 70% of the United States population is susceptible to Rhus dermatitis, which occurs in persons of all ages (Fisher 1986b). The rashes are caused by the chemical urushiol, which is incredibly reactive (a pinhead amount can cause rashes in 500 sensitive people) and remains antigenic indefinitely in the dry state. Lacquer from a Chinese jar, buried for 1,000 years, caused dermatitis (Vietmeyer 1985; Fisher 1986b). Not only can one contact poison ivy dermatitis from the bruised portion of the plant, it can be contacted from contaminated items such a animals, clothing, tools, golf clubs, fishing rods, baseball bats, etc. (Fisher 1986b). Thus someone can acquire poison ivy dermatitis without even going outside. </p>

<p>
31.) Dermatitis from plants, both poisonous and nonpoisonous plants, is surprising] common. Some plants cause dermatitis by merely touching the leaves. Others have to be crushed to release dermatitis-producing chemicals. Others are so toxic that, in some cases, eating them can be fatal. Plant dermatitis may be classified as allergic sensitization, mechanical irritation, chemical irritation, phytophotodermatitis, c pseudophytodermatitis (Mitchell and Fisher 1986). Allergic contact dermatitis can also be caused by ragweed (Ambrosia), sneezeweed (Helenium), sagebrush, won wood, mugwort (Artemisia), boneset (Eupatorium), poverty weed (Franseria marsh elder (Iva), cocklebur (Xanthiurni, burdock (Arctium), chamomile (Anthemis artichoke (Cynara), Gaillardia, and Chrysanthemum species, such as tansy, fev: few, and pyrethrum (Mitchell and Fisher 1986). Even if a plant has been handled by a patient many times, and no outward signs of reaction are apparent, that does not mean that the plant cannot cause dermatitis. Most cases of plant dermatitis are the result of allergic hypersensitivity, which builds up with continuous contact with the given plant, or a closely related species (lvlitchell and Fisher 1986). Poison ivy is the most common plant sensitizer. The following is a list of other fairly common sensitizers (Mitchell and Fisher 1986). Note that these are not all &quot;weeds;&quot; the majority are &quot;cut flowers&quot; or fruits and vegetables.</p>
<ul>
<li>
a.) Ambrosia spp.: giant and dwarf ragweed</li> 
<li>
b.) Dictamnus albus: burning bush and dittany</li>

<li>
c.) Family Compositae: chrysanthemums and daisies</li>

<li>
d.) Family Liliaceae: tulip, hyacinth, asparagus, garlic, and onion e.) Family Amaryllidaceae: amaryllis, daffodil, and narcissus</li>

<li>
f.) Family Umbelliferae: carrots, celery, and wild parsnips</li>

<li>
g.) Family Rutaceae: oranges, lemons, and grapefruits</li>
</ul></p>

<p>
An unusual case of contact dermatitis, reported in two patients, was from in­cense cedar wood used in pencils (Mitchell and Fisher 1986). More than 115 different poisonous plants are found in Florida alone. Many of these plants are cultivated as ornamentals, but most are not restricted to Florida (Maxwell 1963). Some of the more common of these plants are: amaryllis, English ivy, foxglove, lily-of-the-valley, poinsettia, primrose, and sorrel. Primrose is the principle cause of plant dermatitis in Europe (Mitchell and Fisher 1986). After an animal ingests puncture weed, which is found from southern New York to Florida and west from South Dakota to Texas, it becomes sensitive to sunlight and develops swellings and dermatitis on unpigmented parts of the body (Niering 1979).</p>

<p>
32.) Phytophotodennatitis produces skin eruptions caused by the combination of handling fruit, vegetables, or plants and then being exposed to sunlight. Many plants such as celery, parsnips, dill, or parsley contain psoralens - chemicals that sensitize the skin to the effects of ultraviolet light. Some people who have repeated contact with plants or plant parts, and then are exposed to sunlight will develop rashes where the skin has come in contact with psoralens, This is an unusual combination of individual sensitivity and exposures to the right combination of factors so common that they are overlooked as causes of dermatitis. But if there are &quot;fruit flies&quot; which do not have the ability to bite in the area, or if the area was treated with insecticide by a pest management professional, either will most likely be blamed for the rashes.</p>

<p>
33.) Food allergies affect a small proportion of the population, and often disappear spontaneously by the age of 5. Foods that can cause food allergies include dairy prod­ucts, red meat, poultry, eggs, fish, crustaceans, mollusks, tomatoes, carrots, bananas, oranges, pineapples, strawberries, nuts, chocolate, and countless other normally harm­less foods. Manifestations of food allergies include urticaia (nettle rash), asthma, abdominal cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea (Albert 1987). Sometimes allergic reactions are so severe that death ensues."</p>
