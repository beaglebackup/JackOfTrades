<p><strong>INSPECTION.</strong>  Any inspection should begin with a discussion with the customer and their experiences. This gives the technician direction for primary areas to focus on during inspection, although any potential harborage area should be inspected.<p> 

There are two main types of inspection for bed bugs, hand/visual inspection and canine scent detection. These methods are not mutually exclusive and should be used in combination to ensure the most accurate analysis possible.  In some instances, one type of inspection will not be able to be performed due to the conditions of the space. In these cases, the inspection performed should be in-depth and thorough.<p>

<p><strong>HAND INSPECTION.</strong>  Hand/visual inspections are inspections performed by a technician of areas suspected or with the potential to harbor bed bugs. In residential areas these areas include, but are not limited to; beds, nightstands, baseboards, ceiling lines, crown molding, dressers, couches, chairs, closets and any personal items stored in and around these areas. In commercial and government locations inspections can also include: waiting area seating, reception desks, office chairs, desks, exam tables, personnel lockers, computer stations, library books, and communal sitting areas. During inspection, the technician should be looking for any evidence of bed bugs; live bugs, eggs, molted cast skins, fecal staining and blood smears.<p> 

Because bed bugs’ natural instinct is to hide in cracks and crevices, inspections should be in-depth. For sanitary reasons, technicians should always wear gloves while inspecting customers’ belongings. Flashlights should be utilized in order to see into potential harborage areas. Hand mirrors allow for visual inspection in areas that may not otherwise be able to be easily visually inspected (in carpet edges, at crown molding, behind non-movable items, etc.).<p> 

Bed bugs typically harbor within 8 feet of their food source, and as their name suggests, are usually found in the bed and bed area. In most residential calls, the beds should be the primary focus of the inspection. Technicians should begin by inspecting the bed linens. In heavier infestations, bed bugs may be found topically on the bedding, but in lower level infestations evidence is more likely blood smearing or staining and black fecal stains. Bed linens are bagged by the technician and the customer must launder them after treatment in hot water and dry items on high heat. The mattress should then be inspected along all seam lines. After the mattress has been moved off of the bed, the box spring is then inspected. Box springs offer a high level of harborage locations for bed bugs because of their ample hiding space. With the customer’s permission, the technician should remove the dust cover and inspect the inside of the box spring. The plastic protective corners found on many box springs also are potential harborage sites, and should be inspected. Once the box spring has been inspected, it is then removed and the technician then inspects the entire bed frame, taking care to inspect cracks, bed slats, joints and screw holes. Wood frames are more susceptible to infestation since they offer more harborage locations, although metal frames can harbor bed bugs as well. After inspection, the bed is reassembled for the customer.<p> 

When inspecting other furniture items, the technician must be as thorough as possible. Furniture items like couches and chairs should be inspected from every angle, including the underside. Special attention should always be placed on cracks, crevices, joints, screw holes, fabric seams, and any other place likely to harbor bed bugs. The baseboards and carpet edge as well as the ceiling line, especially in the bed area, are inspected for evidence of bed bug activity.<p> 

<p><strong>CANINE INSPECTION FOR BED BUGS.</strong>  Bed bugs produce a number of aggregation and alarm pheromones that can be detected through specific scent detection dogs. Trained in the same manner, and sometimes even in the same place, as drug or bomb sniffing dogs, these dogs are trained to alert to a target odor, in this case live bed bugs. The National Pest Management Association (NPMA) sets specific standards of performance that the dogs must meet to ensure that the dog and handler team are giving the most accurate inspection possible. These teams practice daily to keep all skills at the optimum level.<p> 

The first step in any inspection is to prepare the room. The room is cleared of any hazards or distractions. This includes other animals, food, or any medications on the floor. Any windows should be closed and fans or air conditioning turned off to reduce air movement in the room. At this time, the technician should also perform a hand/visual inspection of the suspected areas. This helps to ensure that the dog is not missing any evidence during their inspection or looks for potential other bite sources if bed bugs are not detected.<p> 

The handler and dog team then inspect the room. The dog sniffs along any areas suspected or potentially harboring bed bugs. If bugs are present, the dog will alert to the location. The K9 handler then confirms any alerts by locating the live bed bugs. If the handler is unable to locate the source of the alert, the customer should be informed.<p> 

The purpose of inspection is to not only confirm the presence of bed bugs, but also determine the level of infestations. Smaller infestations are managed differently than larger infestations, as well as many sites have specific limitations on treatment. These limitations can include size of the unit, layout of the unit, how widespread the infestation is, the level of clutter, financial ability and tenant cooperation.<p> 

In multi-unit buildings such as apartments, condos, hotels and SROs, the San Francisco Department of Public Health’s “Director’s Rules and Regulations for Prevention and Control of Bed Bugs” state that any units adjoining an infested unit; above, below, left or right that share a common floor, wall or ceiling; must be inspected prior to treatment services being rendered. This is to determine the level of infestation within the building as well as prevent reinfestation after treatment services have been completed.<p> 

Bed bug are a stowaway pest, transferring from location to location on people or their belongings or actively traveling through wall voids into new units.  Unless a customer knows of going to a specifically bed bug infested location, it is difficult to nearly impossible to determine where an infestation came from. Inspections can determine structural deficiencies that allow for bed bug harborage or passage into other units.<p> 
	

<p><strong>MONITORING.</strong>  People can have severe reaction to bed bugs bites as well as the disruption of sleep, therefore most customers have little to no threshold for bed bugs. Some people never react to bed bug bites and therefore naturally have a higher threshold level, although typically once physical evidence is present the customer drops in threshold level drastically.  Because of the extremely low tolerance for bed bugs, customers will often self-treat prior to hiring a PCO. It is important to gather as much information about self-treating history as well as educate the customer on proper practices.<p> 

Aside from bites, presence of bed bug evidence; staining, molted cast skins and live bugs; are all evidence of a bed bug infestation.  If a location has a previous history of bed bug infestation, it is beneficial that any old evidence be removed after the infestation has been cleared. This can include encasing mattresses, changing the bedding and painting over any evidence that may still be present. This allows for early detection if an infestation comes back, since visible evidence will be clearly new.<p>

In most residential situations monitoring occurs through the presence of bites or evidence, but in higher-risk locations there are some physical monitoring devices for early detection:<p> 

Trapper Monitors are tented glue boards that are placed along the baseboards or other locations potentially harboring pest activity. There is no attractant in the glue boards, they only capture any insect activity that tries to travel over them. Trapper monitors are installed in all locations with recurring monitoring services and are checked at each inspection.<p> 

Climbup Interceptors are plastic dishes that go on the feet of the bed. When bed bugs climb into the wells of the interceptors they are unable to climb back out. There is a slight amount of talcum powder that acts as a desiccant and dries out the waxy coating on the bed bugs, which eventually kills them. Interceptors are used as part of the treatment process, but can also be used as a long-term monitor in locations with high bed turnover like hospitals or shelters.<p>  

CO2 Traps simulate the presence of a human in an unoccupied room by emitting carbon dioxide. There are a variety of different types of CO2 traps, including Nightwatch devices, CO2 canisters and dry ice traps. CO2 traps typically only have enough supply for a few days and are not a good option for long term monitoring, but are good for locations suspected of having bed bugs that don’t have overnight residents, like offices, or spaces being treated where the regular tenant is not sleeping there.<p> 

	
<p><strong>TREATMENT.</strong>  The IPM approach for bed bugs differs greatly from traditional pest control practices of blanket spraying of toxic chemicals, instead focusing on a multi approach method. Each treatment is targeted to the specific infestation and the needs of the location. There are two main types of treatment, Manual Treatments and Thermal Remediation. Both used a combination of biological, cultural, mechanical, physical and chemical control, although they approach the infestation in different ways. Manual treatments focus on protecting the bed and draining the population over time, whereas thermal remediation treats the entire infestation at once. Both are effective treatments, but often one is better suited to a location than another.<p> 

<p><strong>PHYSICAL &amp; CHEMICAL CONTROL: Manual Treatment</strong>
Manual treatments are a minimum three visit service used to drain the population over time. Manual treatments are ideal for lower level infestations, as well as when thermal treatment ability is restricted or cost is a factor. For manual treatments to be effective, the tenant must be cooperative with recommendations of the technicians.<p> 

Technicians begin by removing any live bed bugs or eggs. Inspection notes can help determine where the infestation is located, but additional hand inspection will help ensure that nothing is missed. For larger infestations, a vacuum can be used.<p> 

Any areas found harboring bed bugs or any items that are likely to harbor bed bugs are then treated for bed bugs. Furniture items, carpet lines and curtains can be treated with steam. Because of its high temperature, steam is an instant contact killer. To ensure proper heat penetration, steam is applied at a rate of 20 seconds per linear foot. Items can also be treated with a reduced-risk pesticide labeled for the location being treated. The current pesticides used for targeting bed bugs are Cedarcide, Cirkil RTU, Cirkil CX, Temprid.<p> 

Once the bed has been cleared of bugs, it is then protected to ensure that no new bugs are able to access the bed. This is done through the installation of Climbup Interceptors and encasements. These ensure that the bed bugs aren’t able to get to their host, the human sleeping in the bed. If bed bugs can’t feed, they cannot grow and reproduce. This allows to tenants to stop receiving bites after the first visit and drains the population over time.<p> 

The next goal is to stop the bed bugs as they move throughout the room and prevent them from traveling to other parts of the house or other units. The technician applies an insecticidal dust at the baseboards and in the wall voids. The predominant insecticidal dust is a variation of Diatomaceous Earth with different additives. These dusts are crushed up diatoms with sharp edges that destroy the waxy coating of the bed bugs so they lose all the moisture in their body. Insecticidal dusts are only applied in very fine amounts with a hand duster; if it is visible there is too much product. Bed bugs will avoid any large patches of dust and the product will not be effective. Trapper monitors should also be installed at this time to monitor pest movement between visits.<p> 

The tenant responsibilities and impacts in a manual treatment are minimal, but they do need to be followed in order for treatment to be effective. During each treatment the technicians will bag all bed linens. The tenant must launder them in hot water and dry them on high prior to putting them back on the bed. The tenant must keep the bed 4-6 inches away from the wall and other furniture items and keep all bedding off the floor if interceptors are installed. Clutter should be reduced around the bed area and no items should be stored under the bed. If treatment services are ineffective due to non-compliance of technician recommendations on the customer’s part, additional fees can be accrued.<p> 

<p><strong>PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CONTROL:  Thermal Remediation</strong>
In higher levels of infestation or for customers looking for a chemical free option, thermal remediation uses high levels of heat to treat an entire space for bed bugs. Live bed bugs and eggs are instantly killed at 122° F. The goal of thermal remediation is to raise the temperature of a space using large heaters and holding the temperature there for several hours.<p> 

Thermal remediation first begins with a pre-treatment. The space is treated in the same manner as a manual treatment, removing and treating for as many bugs in the space as possible. At this time, the technicians will also advise the customer on items that need to be removed prior to treatment. While the temperature range of the thermal remediation process shouldn’t damage most items in the home, some items are more heat sensitive and need to be removed to prevent damage. This includes perishable food items, medications, candles, oil paintings, antique furniture and stringed instruments. Some items can be stored in the refrigerator while others need to be inspected by a technician and removed from the site prior to treatment.<p> 

The wall voids are dusted with insecticidal dust. This prevents the bed bugs from seeking cooler locations during treatment. This is especially important in multi-unit buildings to prevent spreading the infestation into other units. The face plates are removed from electrical outlets and dust is applied inside. In more extreme cases, additional wall voids are created with drills and dust is applied there as well.<p> 

The rooms are set up for optimum heat penetration. Furniture is arranged to maximize the access to the airflow. Mattresses and box springs should be stood tall and leaned against a wall to allow maximum heat exposure. Windows and air vents are covered with insulation to aid in bringing and keeping the unit to the required temperature. All sprinkler heads are covered to prevent from being set off.<p> 

The unit is heated to a minimum of 122° F. The process takes several hours and the tenants and any pets are not allowed in the unit during this time. Once the unit has been brought up to temperature, either with heaters in the unit or air being channeled in from outside the unit, large fans are plugged in to circulate the air throughout the entire unit. After the temperature has leveled off at lethal temperature again, the unit is held at that temperature for several hours. The technicians will rotate larger items periodically to ensure even heat distribution. Tenants may return to their unit after treatment, although typically the unit will retain heat for several hours.<p>

<p><strong>EVALUATION.</strong>  For manual treatments, follow-ups are inspection and re-treatment as needed. The purpose of the treatment is to protect the bed and drain the population over time. Finding bed bugs in monitors and the outer rings of interceptors is common. If bugs are being found on the bed, treatment methods need to be assessed. Follow-ups for thermal remediation are typically K9 inspection and chemical re-treatments are offered if any bed bug activity is found. In both cases, units are considered cleared of bed bugs once they have had two consecutive visits without any bed bug activity found. The final visit should be done with a canine to most accurately determine if there are any more bed bugs.<p> 

Services are scheduled two weeks apart, per the San Francisco Department of Public Health’s bed bug guidelines. Most IPM approved pesticides don’t kill bed bug eggs and the average span of time between a bed bug egg being laid to hatched is about two weeks.  Scheduling follow-ups two weeks apart allows for newly hatched bed bugs to be detected and killed before they can reproduce.  Follow-ups can, and should, be scheduled sooner if the tenant is reporting bites or any live bed bugs.<p> 

After the unit is cleared of bed bugs, there is a 30 day monitoring period. If any bed bugs are found during that time, re-treatment is free of charge. After that period, and inspections or treatments are considered a new service. If bed bugs are a continuing problem in a location, tenant habits should be assessed and a higher value should be placed on education and prevention.<p>
