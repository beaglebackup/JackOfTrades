<h6>Air Doors. </h6> Many food serving facilities install air doors or window screens to keep out flies. Hedges (1994) recommended that air doors not be installed on exterior doorways as the outside weather changes often and can adversely affect the devices&#39; effectiveness. He recommended air doors be used between two interior rooms. Improper instal­lation may actually suck flies and other insects into the building. The manufacturer's instructions and recommendations should be followed closely. In addition to air doors, fans directed at areas where flies are loafing, landing, or feeding will immediately pro­vide a fly free environment as flies are dispersed by wind currents. The author reports excellent results of fly control near salad bars with small oscillating fans. Food can be covered or wrapped in cellophane should dust be an issue of concern.</p>

<p><h6>Insect Light Traps.</h6> Most flies are active during the daytime (diurnal). House flies, blow flies, and many other structure-infesting flies respond well to certain wavelengths of light, and, once inside a building, will be attracted to sunlight and fly to windows. Insect light traps (ILTs) are highly effective in attracting and capturing flies and other flying insects after they enter a building. Installed properly, ILTs work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in alleviating flying insect concerns. The types of in­sects captured by a trap can also alert one to a new infestation of pests or provide clues as to where an infestation is originating. Rambo (1995), in reference to light traps, asked, &quot;Are these control devices or monitoring devices? In talking about IPM programs, I would definitely call them monitoring devices.&quot;</p>
