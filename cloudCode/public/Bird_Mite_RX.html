<p><h6>Bird Mites.</h6> "A number of mites may attack humans when a bird nest is present in the immediate area.  The northern fowl mite, Ornithonyssus sylviarum (Canestrini &amp; Fanzango), and the chicken mite, Dermanyssus gallinae (DeGeer), may attack people when their bird host dies, causing sever itching since bird mites cannot usually survive approximately more than 10 days away from an avian host, removal of bird nests or roosting areas is the long-term solution, coupled with pesticide application (Green 1982; St. Aubin 1982; Bennett et al. 1988)."
