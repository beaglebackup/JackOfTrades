	Liquid Ant Bait.  Intice Thiquid Ant Bait is made with a new technology to target stubborn bait resistant house ants. This thick syrup bait is highly attractive and lethal to all common household ants with the exception of pharaoh, carpenter, fire and harvester ants.

	<p>ADVION ant bait gel is specifically formulated to be tasty to all major species of ants. Advion ant gel contains the new active ingredient, Indoxacarb, a powerful, nonrepellent insecticide. The slight delay in death caused by Indoxacarb, encourages ants to eat the bait and return to the nest site to share the bait with other ants, eventually killing the entire colony. Use of Advion will help eliminate ants within days of application.</p>

<p>This organic pest control formula is ideal for killing bed bugs, ants, earwigs, cockroaches, silverfish, crickets, fleas, millipedes and centipedes. The Safer Brand ant and crawling insect killer utilizes diatomaceous earth (AKA silicon dioxide) which includes a bait formula that kills insects two different ways, by ingestion and/or dehydration within 48 hours. Works indoors and outdoors when kept dry. Comes in a 4 lb. bag for many applications. The efficient nature of this organic pest control product makes it the most economical and convenient solution to the wide array of garden annoyances on the market! This product bears the prestigious OMRI-listed seal as well as the USDA National Organic Program compliant for use in organic gardening seal, certifying this product is organic. Diatomaceous Earth (DE) is a dust-like product that contains the crushed fossilized remains of diatoms. The dust is ingested by the bed bug or other crawling insect, or as the insect crosses through the powder, the DE will cut their exoskeleton, causing them to dehydrate and die. The best part about DE is that insects cannot develop a resistance to it since there are no chemicals to which they can build up an immunity. If the area where the DE is applied becomes wet, it will need to be reapplied. But BEWARE.... all DE is not the same. Safer Brand Ant and Crawling Insect Killer Powder with DE is made from a patented formula containing amorphous diatomaceous earth, known as silicon dioxide. This particular type of DE is derived from fresh water sources and is NOT the same as Diatomite DE which can be derived from unnatural sources and has been linked to cancer. You can shop confidently, knowing that SaferÂ® Brand Ant &amp; Crawling Insect Killer is OMRI listed and contains Amorphous DE.</p>
