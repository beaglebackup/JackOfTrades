<h1>CONTROL OF SMALL FLIES IN STRUCTURES</h1>

<p>
"The key to solving infestations of small flies such as fruit flies or phorid flies, is to find a  of the breeding sources and correct or eliminate them. Insecticide treatments are rarel  needed for these flies except for space treatments to kill remaining adult flies after breeding sources have been removed. Infestations of these flies persist because one or more breeding sources have been overlooked. Because these flies can develop in large numbers from a very small amount of decaying organic matter, this task can be very difficult.  Although a bakery was thoroughly washed each night, flour and moisture collected in cracks under the edge of kitchen equipment at the floor level. Phorid flies were breeding in these cracks by the hundreds. Only by scraping out the fermenting flour, scrubbing the cracks with soap and water, and drying the area with an air compressor was the problem solved (Hedges 1994). The cracks were sealed with a durable caulk to prevent flour from collecting in these areas again.

<p>
<strong>PHORID FLIES.</strong> Phorid fly larvae survive only in moist, decaying organic matter. The first spots that should be checked are the floor drains, if any are present. Fly larvae live in the moist film that develops on the sides of a drain and in debris that may become trapped on the drain&#39;s edge. The presence of numerous adult flies inside a drain is a good sign that the drain is a breeding site for this pest. A knife or a screwdriver can be used to scrape the film off the sides of the drain and examine it for live larvae. Phorid flies also will breed in moist food debris that becomes trapped under equipment in commercial food operations.</p>

<p>
To determine if the phorid flies are exiting from a drain, two cardboard mouse glue traps may be formed into ring and placed over the drain overnight by the pest management professional. A clear plastic cup also may be taped over a crack or hole and will capture flies as they exit the drain. In extreme cases, it may be necessary to drill/core a hole through the concrete slab as discusse earlier under phorid fly biology.</p>

<p>
In crawlspaces, the drain line must be fixed, the area dried, and a space treatment applied to kill adult flies. Under slabs, it may be necessary for the facility to have plumbing company repair the break in the pipe and remove and replace any contaminated soil to solve the problem.</p>
