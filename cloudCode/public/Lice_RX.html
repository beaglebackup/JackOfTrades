<h4>Treatment of Head Lice</h4>
"To avoid acquiring head lice, caps, combs, and other headgear should not be shared.  Control of lice infestations can be accomplished using various commercial preparations containing insecticides.  This should be done only after positive identification of the parasite and then with caution as insecticides are toxic.  While short hair is more easily searched for lice and nits, it does not prevent lice infestation.<p>

Infestations may be treated with shampoos containing permethrin or pyrethrins specifically labeled for use on people.  Some formulations also contain a synergist, a chemical that may enhance activity of the insecticide.  Stronger preparations (3%-5%) are available by prescription, as are shampoos containing organochlorines (lindane) or organophosphates (malathion).  As with any insecticide or drug, users should read and follow the label directions.  Because these products have limited ovicidal (egg-killing) activity, a second treatment is often necessary about 10 days later targeting lice hatched after the initial treatment.  Lice may not be immediately killed and pediculicides do not remove louse eggs from the hair.  Patient compliance is enhanced by tactics that are easy to use, unobtrusive, and effective.<p>

The main difficulty in eradicating louse infestations is the problem or reinfestation.  Deloused individuals may be reinfested from their associates.  To be successful, treatments must be acceptable to the infested population, facilitating usage.  As most infestations have existed for weeks rather than days before they are discovered, contacts over the previous month should be traced.  This reduces the risk of reinfestation to the patient as well as the degree of potential louse transmission at large.<p>

Louse or nit combs can be useful in removing lice and eggs.  Some louse combs are better than others; their effectiveness depends on their composition (metal or plastic) and better construction (length and spacing of the comb teeth), hair texture, technique and time expended in combing.  Delousing should be conducted using a suitable bright light with magnification to inspect and comb through the hair, one small section at a time, repeated daily until no more active lice are observed.<p>

Caps, combs, brushes, and other hair accessories in contact with an infested person should be washed in hot water each day to dislodge any lice and nits.  Washing and drying (with heat) bed linens, nightclothes, towels and stuffed animals may possibly eliminate lice and eggs that might otherwise reinfest a family member.  Insecticidal treatments targeted at lice within the school or home, in vehicles, or to carpets and furniture are unwarranted, and may unnecessarily expose occupants to insecticide residues (Meinking 1999).  Pets are of no significance in maintaining or transmitting human lice, and should not be treated for head lice.<p>

Because body and head lice are personal pest problems, not environmental pest problems there is no appropriate role for pest management professional involvement.  While parents and school administrators may seek pesticidal applications as insurance while dealing with louse outbreaks, they should be educated regarding louse life cycles and behavior, rather than appeased by providing services inappropriate for the situation.<p>

Sufferers should be reminded that herbal remedies and other "natural" products have no quality assurance and no governmental oversight.  Neither a guarantee that what is stipulated on the label reflects the content nor that the contents are safe for use should be assumed."<p>
