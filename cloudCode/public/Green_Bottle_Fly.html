<h1>Green Bottle Fly </h1>
<h2>(Lucilia sericata)</h2>

<p><strong>Background Information.</strong> 
Because of their association with decaying matter and well documented
lifecycle, the presence and age of green bottle flies are often used
to determine the time of death in forensics. The maggots are used to
clean wounds of living humans in some medical procedures. 
</p>

<p><strong>Distribution &amp; Habitat.</strong> 
Green bottle flies are commonly found in temperate and tropical
climates throughout the world. Green bottle flies are found around
decaying animal matter, meat, garbage and animal feces. They are
often an indicator of carrion nearby and are typically found around
dumpsters. Green bottle flies are not generally house infesting
pests, but if a large number are found an inspection should be done
for dead animals, such as rodents in wall voids. 
</p>

<p><strong>Identification.</strong>
 Adults range in size from 1/4- 1/2 inch in length. They metallic
green, blue-green or golden in color. The back typically has dark
hairs on it. 
</p>

<p><strong>Life Cycle.</strong> Female
green bottle flies lay 150-200 eggs at a time, usually in meat, fish,
decaying animal matter or animal feces. Eggs are 1.5 mm in length,
elongated and whitish in color. Females can lay up to 600 eggs in
their lifetime, with up to 4 to 8 generations per year.  If there is
enough moisture eggs can hatch immediately. Larva feed on decaying
tissue. Larval go through three instars and then crawl to drier areas
to pupate. Pupae are in a harden case that starts white but darkens
to brown or black within a few hours. They become adults in anywhere
from 2 days to 3 weeks depending on external conditions. They can
overwinter in any life stage.</p>

<p><strong>Feeding Behavior.</strong>  The
green bottle fly is a scavenger. They will feed on flowering plants
that mimic the smell of carrion and help pollinate those plants. 
</p>

<p><strong>Health Concerns.</strong>  Because
of their association with decaying matter and garbage, green bottle
flies are known to carry various pathogens. They transfer these
pathogens by landing on food products.
