<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font color="#1f497d"><b>BACKGROUND
INFORMATION.</b></font>  Because of their association with decaying
matter and well documented lifecycle, the presence and age of green
bottle flies are often used to determine the time of death in
forensics. The maggots are used to clean wounds of living humans in
some medical procedures.

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font color="#1f497d"><b>DISTRIBUTION
&amp; HABITAT.</b></font>  Green bottle flies are commonly found in
temperate and tropical climates throughout the world. Green bottle
flies are found around decaying animal matter, meat, garbage and
animal feces. They are often an indicator of carrion nearby and are
typically found around dumpsters. Green bottle flies are not
generally house infesting pests, but if a large number are found an
inspection should be done for dead animals, such as rodents in wall
voids.

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font color="#1f497d"><b>IDENTIFICATION.</b></font>
 Adults range in size from 1/4- 1/2 inch in length. They metallic
green, blue-green or golden in color. The back typically has dark
hairs on it.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font color="#1f497d"><b>LIFE
CYCLE.	</b></font>Female green bottle flies lay 150-200 eggs at a
time, usually in meat, fish, decaying animal matter or animal feces.
Eggs are 1.5 mm in length, elongated and whitish in color. Females
can lay up to 600 eggs in their lifetime, with up to 4 to 8
generations per year.  If there is enough moisture eggs can hatch
immediately. Larva feed on decaying tissue. Larval go through three
instars and then crawl to drier areas to pupate. Pupae are in a
harden case that starts white but darkens to brown or black within a
few hours. They become adults in anywhere from 2 days to 3 weeks
depending on external conditions. They can overwinter in any life
stage.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font color="#1f497d"><b>FEEDING
BEHAVIOR.</b></font>  The green bottle fly is a scavenger. They will
feed on flowering plants that mimic the smell of carrion and help
pollinate those plants.

<font color="#1f497d"><b>HEALTH CONCERNS.</b></font>  Because of
their association with decaying matter and garbage, green bottle
flies are known to carry various pathogens. They transfer these
pathogens by landing on food products.
