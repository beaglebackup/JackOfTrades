<h1>Little House Flies</h1>
<h2>Fannia spp.</h2>


<p>

“The five main species of little house flies belonging to the genus Fannia are similar in appearance and habitat to the house fly but differ in being appreciably smaller and having distinctive wing venation.  The males are commonly found inside building, particularly those that are air conditioned, when outside temperatures rise above 80*F.  Males fly about in the rooms for extended periods of time and seldom rest, while the females rarely enter buildings and typically fly for only short periods of time.<p> 
Eggs are usually deposited on decaying vegetable matter or excrement of several species of animals.  The eggs hatch in 24 to 36 hours, and the resulting larvae appear as flattened elongate-ovate organisms with lateral protuberances that are feathered in Fannia scalaris (F.).  The other species are not as clearly marked.<p>
These flies may cause intestinal myiasis in man and possibly may transfer pathogenic organisms.  Smart (1943) noted the flat spiny maggots “are very characteristic and are to be found in the dired parts of manure heaps and other places where there is decaying organic matter.”  Ehmann, in 1955, surveyed chicken-egg-producing establishments in the San Fernando Valley of Southern California.  The hens were confined to rows of cages about 3 feet off of the ground.  Their manure piled up in cone-shaped mounds beneath them with water from the cages creating a perfect larval habitat for lesser house fly larvae.  Breaking off the top of a cone revealed thousands of latrine fly larvae, Fannia scalaris (F.).<p>
Hewitt (1914) found the little house fly, Fannia canicularis (L.), to commonly breed in human excrement, and that next to the house fly, it was the most common fly found in homes in the early 1900s.  Recycling centers that receive mulch, grass clippings, and leaf litter may harbor and produce huge populations of little house flies.<p>
Lewallen (1954) studied the life history of this fly at 80*F and 65% relative humidity.  The egg stage requires 36 to 40 hours, the larval stage eight to 10 days, and the pupal stage eight to 12 days.  The complete life cycle is 24 to 29 days.  Steve (1960) had results somewhat similar to those by Lewallen.<p>
The latrine fly is very similar in appearance and life history to the little house fly and shows a preference for human excrement.  It is known to cause intestinal myiasis in humans.  Hewitt (1914) showed how to separate this species from the little house fly by the rounded protuberance of the median point of the middle pair of legs of the latrine fly.”<p>
