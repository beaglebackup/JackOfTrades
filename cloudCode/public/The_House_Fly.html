<h1>The
House Fly</h1>
<h2>Musca
domestica L. </h2>

<p>
“The house fly is one of the most
familiar of all insects and is cosmopolitan in distribution.  The
house fly is 1/6 to ¼ inch (4 to 7.5 mm) in length, with the female
usually larger than the male.  The size of both sexes depends to some
extent on the availability of food in the larval stage and whether
the abdomen is distended with food at the time of examination.  The
thorax bears four narrow black stripes and a sharp upward bend is
present in the fourth longitudinal wing vein.  The sexes can be
readily separated by noting the space between the eyes, which in
females is almost trice as broad as in males, or by applying pressure
to the abdomen, which results in the protrusion of an ovipositor in
the case of the female.  The most current readily available resources
on house flies are generated by university research centers,
government agencies, such as the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA), manufacturers’ research data, and the National
Pest Management Association (NPMA) Technical Resource Center.

<p><strong>Feeding Habits.</strong> 
Fermenting, fresh animal manure is a favorite breeding medium of the
house fly.  This manure must be less than one day old to be
attractive to the egg-laying adult.  The most important breeding
sites, in descending order, are horse manure, human excreta
(privies), cow manure, fermenting vegetable refuse, Dumpsters and
refuse containers and household garbage.  All types of flies can live
and breed unchecked in recycling containers and centers.  Hedges
(1994) found house flies breeding in rotting vegetables stored on a
shelf in a hotel kitchen.  Around the home, dog manure is a common
breeding site.</p>

<p><strong>Biology/Life History.</strong>  Thomas
and Jesperson (1994) examined the biology, economic importance, and
control of four of the most important non-biting muscids, including
the house fly and the face fly.  The house fly passes through four
stages in its life cycle: egg, larva or maggot, pupa, and adult.  The
females, usually in clusters of 20 to 50, can be seen depositing
their eggs on a suitable breeding medium.  The white eggs, about 1 mm
in length, are laid singly but pile up in small masses.  During the
female’s lifetime, she may lay five or six batches of 75 to 150
eggs at intervals of several days between each batch.  All in all,
she may deposit from 350 to 900 eggs, and one female was known to
deposit 2.387 in 21 batches (Dunn 1923).  Ordinarily the house fly
commences to lay her eggs from four to 12 days after emerging from
the pupal case and tends to favor moist materials for egg deposition.
 Eggs that become too dry during the incubation period fail to hatch.
 The white, legless maggots emerge from the eggs in warm weather
within eight to 20 hours, and they immediately begin feeding. 
Completion of the larval stage requires three to seven days at
temperatures of 70°F to 90°F (21°C to 32°C), although six to eight
weeks may be required at lower temperatures.  The full grown maggot
has a greasy, cream-colored appearance and is 7 to 10 mm long.  It
can be separated from the blow fly’s maggot with which it may
otherwise be confused by the sinuous (snakelike in appearance) slits
in the posterior spiracles. 
</p>

<p>The
larvae undergoes three instars before fully grown, and then migrates
from its food source seeking a dry, cool place to pupate, such as
soil beneath nearby boards or stones.  Barber (1919) observed house
fly larvae to migrate 150 feet (45.7 m) to a sewage manhole rather
than pupate in the warm soil beneath a manure pile.  The larvae may
be in the pre-pupal or migrating stage for three to four days.</p>

<p>The
pupa stage is passed in a pupal case formed from the last larval skin
that varies in color as the pupa ages from yellow, red, and brown to
black.  Ordinarily, the size of the maggot determines the size of the
pupa that, in turn, determines the size of the adult fly.  Moreland
and McLeod (1957) noted that smaller pupae are mostly male, while the
larger ones are mostly female.  Arnold Mallis noted that pupae reared
in the laboratory of Gulf Research and Development Co. weighed 18 to
24 mg with an average weight of 21 mg, and 1,350 pupae weighted about
1 ounce (28.4 g).  The pupal stage lasts from three days to four
weeks or longer, depending primarily on temperature and humidity.</p>

<p>The
emerging fly escapes from the pupal case through the use of an
alternately swelling and shrinking sac, or ptilinum, on the front of
its head that it uses like a pneumatic hammer.  Bucher et al. (1948)
noted that at about 80°F (26.7°C) “about one hour is required after
emergence for expansion of the wing spand general hardening of the
body.  At this temperature, the adults remain relatively quiescent
for about the first four hours.  Normal activity is reached in about
15 hours.” Warm summer conditions are generally optimum for the
development of the house fly, which completes its life cycle in as
little as six days (Metcalf et al. 1951).  As many as 10 to 12
generations may occur in one summer.  Lysyk (1992) noted that weekly
changes in house fly abundance were not influenced by temperature.</p>

<p>The
life span of the adult house fly is two to three days without food
and from a few days to 54 days with food (Hutchinson 1916). 
According to Hewitt (1914), adult flies have been kept alive in the
laboratory by investigators for as long as 16 weeks.  Bucher et al.
(1948) found that for a short time immediately following emergence,
house flies did not consume food, and they began feeding when they
first became active, which in turn was dependent upon environmental
conditions.  
</p>

<p>The
potential reproductive capacity of flies is tremendous, but
fortunately can never be realized.  Hodges (1991) stated, “A pair
of flies beginning operations in April may be progenitors, if all
were to live, of 191,010,000.000,000,000,000, flies by August. 
Allowing one-eighth of a cubic inch to a fly, this number would cover
the Earth 47 feet deep.”</p>

<p><strong>The House Fly &amp; Disease.</strong>
 Although the house fly is often an unbearable nuisance, we are
primarily concerned with it as a carrier of disease organisms.  The
house fly feeds on fecal material, vomit, and sputum, after which it
might alight on human food.  Moreover, flies commonly fall into
liquid foods, thus causing contamination.  Under microscopic
examination, it can be understood why flies carry pathogens such as
bacteria and other disease-causing organisms.  The fine hairs
covering a fly’s body may harbor disease pathogens, and that
combined with their ability to quickly fly distance means flies have
little trouble spreading bacteria and pathogens.</p>

<p>The
house fly is very well adapted by both structure and behavior for the
transmission of disease.  At the base of each of the two claws at the
end of each leg is a cushion-like structure, the pulvillus, that is
covered with glandular hairs that exude sticky secretions.  These
structures enable the fly to climb vertical surfaces and to walk
upside down.  The house fly cannot digest solids so it excretes
stomach acids and regurgitates wherever it comes to rest.  According
to Barber and Starnes (1949), fly regurgitation “is a process of
digestion during which the food is brought up from the crop bit by
bit and is mixed with saliva before being passed on to the digestive
tract.”</p>

<p>House
flies have been shown to carry the disease organisms causing typhoid
fever, cholera, summer diarrhea, dysentery, tuberculosis, anthrax,
and ophthalmia, as well as parasitic worms.   Watt and Lindsay (1948)
noted that fly control reduced infection, disease, and death due to
diarrhea in Texas.  Frison (1925) recorded the regurgitation of house
fly larvae by a sick boy.  Greenberg (1967) prepared an interesting
article on house flies as vectors of Salmonella bacteria responsible
for food poisoning and gastric infections.  Experimental work has
demonstrated the presence of the virus that causes poliomyelitis in
or on flies trapped in epidemic areas, and flies in homes of polio
patients can contaminate food with the virus.”</p>
