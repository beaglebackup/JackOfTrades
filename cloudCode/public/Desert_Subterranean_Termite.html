<h1>Desert Subterranean Termite</h1>
<h2>Heterotermes aureus (Snyder)</h2>

<p>
“The desert subterranean termite,
Heterortermes aureus, has a limited distribution in the United
States, but is very destructive in the desert regions of Southern
Arizona and California.  It also is common along the west coast of
Mexico (Snyder 1954b).  The species attacks many types of wood,
including dead cactus “ribs,” desert trees such as mesquite, and
utility poles, posts and structural timbers.</p>

<p>The
soldiers appear similar to another subterranean termite species in
the region, R. tibialis, except that H. aureus soldiers have
mandiables that are more slender.  The swarmers, however, are easy to
distinguish by their pale yellowish brown in color, contrasting with
the darker bodied swarmers of Reticulitermes.  In contrast to
day-swarming Reticulitermes species, the desert subterranean termite
swarms at night.</p>

<p>Pickens
and Light (1934) suggested that the range of this termite is favored
by the expansion of development into the desert.  Irrigation brings
more moisture, and artificially heated buildings serve as an
attraction during cooler weather.  Ettershand et al. (1980) and
others found that desert subterranean termites  are often attracted
to the “thermal shadows” cast by objects, such as dung patties,
vegetative cover, or buildings.  Apparently, the termites orient to
these objects in part by detecting temperature gradients in the soil,
irrespective of whether they are of any nutritive value.</p>

<p>In
the Sonoran Desert region of southern Arizona, Jones et al (1987)
also observed that H. aureus preferred to forage in more vegetated
sites.  In this area, the species is active year round with high but
erratic foraging during the summer months, corresponding with the
rainy season.  Foraging was found to be more moderate in spring and
summer and minimal during the winter (Haverty et al. 1974; Jones et
al. 1987).  Efforts to estimate foraging territory and colony density
have yielded much variation, as often occurs with other subterranean
species.  Initial estimates by Haverty et al. (1975) suggested very
large numbers of H. aureus colonies (more than 75) per acre, and
rather small (12.5 m2) foraging areas.  Subsequent estimates by Jones
(1990) using less arbitrary (albeit, still controversial)
mark-recapture methods suggested that foraging territories may in
fact be much larger, encompassing several hundred to a few thousand
square meters.</p>

<p>While
Heterotermes and Reticulitermes share many similarities in their
biology, subtle differences exist in their behavior.  Industry
practitioners describe H. aureus as a rather “skittish” or
“finicky” termite, particularly in reference to baiting.  They
tend to feed for a time in bait stations, disappear for a while and
then reappear.  Although their tunneling within structures can be
extensive, it is often difficult to achieve sustained feeding in bait
stations installed above ground.  Within buildings, Heterotermes
often constructs free-hanging ‘drop’ tubes, suspended from
ceilings, soffits and other overhead surfaces.”</p>
