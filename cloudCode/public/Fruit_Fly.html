<h1>Fruit Fly</h1>
<h2>(Drosophila melanogaster)</h2>

<p><strong>Background Information.</strong>  Fruit
flies are an extensively studied species and are often used for
studies in genetics. 
</p>

<p><strong>Distribution &amp; Habitat.</strong> 
Fruit flies can be found anywhere fruit is allowed to rot or ferment.
They are less associated with fruit decaying due to bacteria or
fungi. They can especially be a problem in food storage and
production areas. 
</p>

<p><strong>Identification.</strong> Fruit flies are
approximately 1/8th inch long with red eyes and an orange, tan, or
dark body. 
</p>

<p><strong>Life Cycle.</strong>  Female
fruit flies lay 10-20 eggs in fruit, with an average of 400 eggs laid
in their lifetime. These eggs, that are approximately 0.5 mm long,
will hatch out 2-12 days later. The larval stage lasts 1-4 weeks,
during which they will burrow into the fruit. They will then become
pupa for approximately 1-2 weeks, during which time they will move to
drier areas of the fruit or outside of it entirely. From egg to adult
can take 3-4 weeks depending on environmental conditions. Females are
able to mate 8-12 hours after emerging as adults. Adults can survive
up to a year. 
</p>

<p><strong>Feeding Behavior.</strong>  As their
name suggests, fruit flies are associated with fruit and other
decaying organic matter. Larvae eat the yeasts in fermenting fruit
and are often found in association with rotting bananas, pineapples,
tomatoes, pickles, potatoes or other decaying vegetables.  
</p>

<p><strong>Health Concerns.</strong>  Fruit
flies are often associated with unsanitary conditions and decaying
matter, so there is always the potential for the spread of bacteria
to food items.
