<h1>Thief Ants</h1>
<h2>Solenopsis (Diplorhoptrum) species</h2>
<h2>Subfamily Myrmicinae</h2>

<p><strong>Identifying Characteristics.</strong> 
“The workers are monomorphic and small, 1.5 to 2.2 mm long.  They
have a two-segmented petiole.  Their antennae are 10-segmented club. 
Depending on the species, their body color ranges from brown to
yellow (Vail et al. 1994).  They are often confused with Pharaoh ants
because both are small and similar in color, but Pharaoh ant has a
three-segmented antennal club.</p>

<p><strong>Distribution.</strong>
 Thief Ants are distributed throughout the U.S.  The most common
household pest in this group is S. molesta.</p>

<p><strong>Biology &amp; Habits.</strong> 
Their name is derived from the habit of some species that nest close
to other, larger ants and enter their nest to steal food and prey
upon brood (Smith 1965; Thompson 1990).  Because they are so often
mistaken for other ants, their significance as pests is unknown
(Hedges 1997).</p>

<p>Outdoors,
nests are found in exposed soil, under rocks, or in rotting wood
(Smith 1965).  Indoors, they nest in woodwork and masonry (Smith
1965).  They use electric wires in wall voids to move from one room
to another (Hedges 1992).</p>

<p>Thief
ants are omnivorous.  They prey upon fire ant queens and other
insects (Vail et al. 1994).  Occasionally, they are responsible for
injury to sprouting seeds and vegetables and are believed to hollow
out seeds for their oil content (Mallis 1969).“</p>
