<h1>Ticks</h1>
<h2>Suborder Ixodida</h2>

<p>

"Ticks are bloodsucking ectoparasites of mammals, birds, and reptiles.  These arthropods have a six-legged larval stage, one or more eight-legged nymphal stages, and an eight legged adult stage, all of which take blood meals.  Femals of all species and the males of most species feed on blood.  Oliver (1989) stated: "Approximately 80 of the estimated 850 described tick species occur in the United States."<p>

In addition to annoyance and discomfort, ticks are effecient vectors of a number of serious diseases of humans and domestic animals.  Gladney (1978) states: "In fact, in temperate and tropical countries, ticks surpass all other arthropods in the number and variety of diseases which they transmit to domestic animals, and they run mosquitoes a close second in the number of diseases transmitted to humans."<p>
A pathogen is an organism which causes disease in the animal in infects.  Pathogens occur in several forms.  Typical viral diseases transmitted by ticks include Colorado tick fever, Powassan encephalities, and tick-borne encephalities (Europe).  Pathogenic bacteria transmitted by ticks incldue Lyme disease, relapsing fiver, and tularemia organisms.  There is at least one protozoan pathogen carried by ticks - human babesiosis.  Finally, tick-borne rickettsiae cause human diseases such as Rock Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis, and endemic typhus.<p>

Pathogen acquisitions and behavior inside the vector is very important in disease transmission.  Two factors contribute greatly to the successful spread of a pathogen in ticks.  A pathogen can be passed through the stages of the vector's development (e.g., from larva to nymph, to adult), a process known as trans-stadial transmission.  With trans-ovarial transmission, the pathogen is passed from the mother to her offspring through her eggs.  These two processes are found in both ticks and mites.  For example, newly hatched Dermacentor andersoni tick larvael are capable of transmitting the Rocky Mountain spotted fever organisms to animals and (ultimately) humans if the mother has passed the pathogen on to her eggs.<p>

As stated earlier, pest managment professionals must be able to do more than just identify these pests.  The biology, their life cycles, and the cylce of the pathogens in the animals they parasitize must also be understood.  Knowledge of epidemiology of a tickborne disease can often reduce case numbers and the harm these pests do without the need for widespread broadcast application of insecticides.  As a case in point, removal of the deer population from Great Island, Mass., vastly reduced occurence of the vector of Lyme disease, with which some 20% of the human inhabitants of hte island were inflicted (Wilson et al. 1988).<p>

While it is obvious that such drastic action may be aesthetically undesirable, it does point the way to other possible tick control solutions.  Understanding the life cycle and bionomics of a vector permits the pest management professional to engage in control measures to which he is accustomed as well as to move to a higher, more environmentally sound, form of pest management.<p>

<p><strong>Tick classification.</strong>  Ticks occur in two basic forms and are thus divided into two families: Ixodidae, the hard ticks, and Argasidae, the soft ticks.  Hard and soft when describing ticks, refers to presence or absence of a hard plate on their back, called the scutum.  Refer to the pictorial key to genera of adult ticks in the United States for identifying important tick species.<p>

Hard ticks are characterized as follows: only one nymphal stage; mouthparts projecting forward and visible from above; respiratory openings or stigmata located near the fourth pair of legs; a scutum, or shield-like plate, present on the back of the body and covering the entire back of the male but only the front part of the back of the female; the coxa, or basal segement, of each leg usually with a spur (projection or spine); festoons (rectangular areas separated by grooves) present along the posterior margin of the body on all North American hard ticks except the genus Ixodes; palpi (in the mouthparts) containing four secgments, the fourth segment very small.  Hard ticks feed on blood once for each of the stages (unless feeding is interrupted).<p>

Soft ticks have more than one nymphal stage, some having up to eight.  Their mouth-parts (in the nymphal and adult stages) are ventrally located and covered by the front margin of the body, making them not visible from above.  Stigmata occur between legs three and four, the bodies lack a scutum, and the integument (skin) appears wrinkled and leathery.  The coxae lack spurs, and festoons are absent.  Palpal segements are equal in size.  Soft ticks feed periodically during all life stages.<p>

Some hard ticks have a one-host life cycle, wherein engorged larvae and nymphs remain on the host after feeding.  Adults mate on that same host, and only the engorged female drops to the ground to lay eggs.  While some hard ticks complete their development on only one or two hosts, most commonly encountered ixodids have a three-host life cycle, meaning they feed, drop off, and then get on another animal each time (three times).<p>

Most soft ticks are "multi-host ticks."  The six-legged larva and the three or four nymphal stages each feed once, while the adult female will feed several times, with which engorgement usually followed by oviposition.  Five molts are typical, which means that five difference host animals must be located for the entire life cycle to be completed.<p>

Note that the one-host, two-host, and three-host designation has nothing to do with host specificity.<p>

<h1>Important Soft Ticks</h1>
<h2>(Family Argasidae)</h2>
<p>
<p><strong>Fowl Ticks [Argas persicus group].</strong>  Fowl ticks are found worlwide and are among the most important poultry parasites.  However, modern poultry production practicies in the U.S. have made this pest relatively rare.  Depending upon the locale, the fowl tick is variously referred to as the "chicken tick," "adobe tick," "blue bug," and "tampan."  Nymphs and adults are extremely active at night, but hide in roost areas and around droppings pits during the day.  At times, this species will roam widely and, in so doing, may invade homes, where it will readily attempt to feed upon humans.  Several species of fowl ticks occur.  Argas radiatus Railliet is foudn widely in the United States, but chiefly in the Sourth.  Argags sanchezi is found throughout the Southwest.  Argas persicus (Oken) is also found in the United States, nut much less often than A. radiatus.<p>

Females lay their eggs in masses of 25 to more than 100 inside the cracks and crevices where they hide.  Each female deposits several egg batches, each preceded by teh taking of a blood meal, and lays a total of 500 to 700 eggs.  Hatching takes place within anywhere from 10 days to three or four weeks, depending on temperature and humidity.  Larvae are very active, apparently attacking a host as readily during the day as at night.  Once larvae attach, they feed for about five days; they then detach, leave the host, and enter a quiet period of about a week.  At that time, they molt, enter the first nymphal stage and begin nocturnal feeding, returning during the day to the shelter of cracks and crevices.  A total of three, and occasionally four, nymphal stages occur, all feeding in the same manner; the last stage molts into an adult.<p>

<p><strong>Pigeon Tick [Argas relexus (F.)].</strong>  The pigeon tick may be easily separated from fowl ticks by the upturned  margin around its body.  Its habits are similar to that of fowl ticks in that the pigeon tick also hides by day and feeds by night.  Areas under eaves and around cornices of buildings where pigeons roost will be likely harborages.  If those locations are near windows or airtakes for heating, ventilating, or air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, pigeon ticks may easily enter and attack people within, although not so severely and readily as do fowl ticks.<p>

<p><strong>Relapsing fever ticks.  [ornithodoros hermsi Wheeler, Herms, and Meyer; Ornithodoros turicata (Duges)].</strong>  Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) this disease characterized by periods of fever alternating with afebrile periods.  It occurs throughout much of the world, bu in the U.S., most cases occur in northern California, Oregon, and Washing where Ornithodoros hermsi is the vector.  This species infests cabins in the mountains of California, other parts of the United States, and nortward into British Columbia.  Another tick, Ornithodoros turicata (Duges), carries the approvaed common name of "relapsing fever tick" but is generally foudn in arid areas, living in rodent or tortoise burrows, and therefore it is not as likely to be encountered by humans.  Thompson, et al. (1969) reported an outbreak of tick-borne relapsing fever involving 11 of 42 Boy Scouts and Soutmasters camping near Spokane, Wash., in 1968.  All but one of the infected people had slept in one of the cabins infested with rodents and O. hermsi.  A similar outbreak occurred on the north rim of the Grand Canyon, Ariz., with 16 confirmed and 46 clinically diagnosed cases (Hardwood and James 1979).<p>

<h2>(Family Ixodidae)</h2>
<p><strong>Brown Dog Tick. [Rhipicephalus sanguineus (latreille)].</strong>  The brown dog tick is not only as pest of dogs but very often is an unbearable nuisance in the home.  Adults of this species generally reside in the ears and between the toes of the dog, while the larvae or "seed ticks," as well as nymphs, are found in the long hair along the back.  Heavy infestations on an animal can greatly reduce the animal's vitality as well as making it irritable.<p>

This tick is not a normal resident of wooded areas and fields; its habitat occurs whereever domestic dogs are found.  Dogs do not acquire brown dog ticks directly from other dogs, however.  Each active stage, after engorging, drops from the animal, either to molt or to lay eggs.  Each dog picks up ticks from an infested residence, kennel, veterinarian's office, or similar location.  In the southern United States, dogs may pick up brown dog ticks from premises surrounding buildings, and the same may be true farther north in warmer months of the year.  This tick, however, cannot survive outdoors in the northern portions of the United States.<p>

The engorged femaled lays eggs from a few hundred to more than 5,000 eggs in cracks and crevices, carpeting, beneath baseboards, and beneath loose plaster or other wall coverings.  After the larvae emerge from the egg, they are capable of surviving for up to eight months without feeding.  The larvae will lie in wait, usually on the lower portions of walls, for a dog to brush by.  Once a dog comes in contact with a point of concealment, the larvae crawl into the animal and commence feeding.  After engorging with blood, which takes from three to six days, they drop off the animal and resume hiding in cracks and crevices or similar locations.  After one to three weeks, larvae molt into the nymphal stage.  After a few days in a quiescent state, they find their way onto another dog and resume feeding.  They can wait as long as three months at this point before finding another animal and feeeding again.  Engorgement takes from four to nine days, after which they once again drop off the animal and go into hiding.  From two to four weeks later, nymphs molt and adults emerge.  At this point they attach to the dog, in places described earlier, and once again feed.  The brown dog tick adult can live without attachment and feeding for very long periods of time.  Bishopp (1939) stated: "For instance, some adults have lived in confinement for over 200 days."  After feeding, the adult drops to the ground to lay eggs and begin the cycle anew.<p>

Under ideal conditions, the life cycle may be completed in as little as 63 days.  Accordingly, given local conditions, generally two generations occur per year in the North and four generations in the South.<p>

Unfortunately, although their preferred host is the domestic dog in the U.S., this tick will occasionally attempt to feed on humans.  The threat of secondary inflection at the site of the bite and even blood poisoning is always a possibility with any tick bite."<p>
