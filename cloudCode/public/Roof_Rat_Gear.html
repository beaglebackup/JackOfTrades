<p><strong>Trapping Roof Rats.</strong>  Roof rats are more difficult to trap than Norway rats.  Most success is achieved by identifying active areas in and around attics and soffits where the rats tend to nest.  Many times, these areas are the darkened tight corners within the attics and soffits.<p>

Traps should be affixed to the beams where signs of roof rats (Grease Marks) are located.  Pratt et al. (1976) discussed and diagrammed this technique.  Traps (or bait stations) can be held in place readily on rafter and beams with elastic bungee cords or velcro.  Because the natural foods of roof rats are fruits, nuts, insects, slugs, and snails, any of these can serve as effective baits (Marsh and Baker 1987).  Professionals who inspect attics in roof rat-infested areas often comment on seeing the empty snail shells of those consumed by the rats.  Thus trying snails and/or snail shells to trap may attract even the most shy roof rat.<p>

<p><strong>Ultrasonic Devices.</strong>  "Ultrasonic machines generate sounds which are beyond those of human hearing (greater than 20 kHz).  Rats can hear within a  range of up to 100 kHz and mice up to 90 kHz.<p>

As of 2003, ultrasonic machines are still sold widely over-the-counter in hardware stores and neighborhood "mart" stores, as well as in garden and specialty tool catalogs of all types.  Some researchers (McCartnet and Jackson 1986, 1988) reported that wild rodents in field situations can be affected by ultrasonic machines, and their normal activities and travel routes can be altered.  Thus, it may be possible to channel rodents into desired areas, or possibly repel them from specific areas."<p>

<p><strong>Electromagnetic Devices.</strong>  "Electromagnetic devices are supposed to work on the principle that a magnetic field produces a barrier that has a stunning or repellent effect on rodents.  Sometimes, electromagnetic devices are confused with ultrasonic devices; however, the two are entirely difference.  As of 1996, however, at least one company still markets a machine which claims to incorporate both electromagnetic and ultrasonic effects.<p>

Pest Control magazine (Anonymous 1977) reported after interviewing some of the top experts in the country, that no scientific evidence is available to show these devices work.  In 1979, EPA had obtained federal court orders prohibiting the sale of several electromagnetic devices because they did not work (Anonymous 1979a).  Despite this, advertisements for such devices can still occasionally be seen.   Nothing has changed as of 2003 - such devices would have no more effect on rodents than a common household appliance (Frantz and Davis 1991).  Their use should be avoided."<p>

<p><strong>Controlling with Rodenticides.</strong>  "Rodenticides are pesticides that kill rodents, and modern rodenticides consist of two broad groups: anticoagulants and non-anticoagulants.<p>

The older rodenticides Antu, arsenic, barium carbonate, DDT, norbormide, phosphorous paste, red squil, sodium fluoroacetate (compound 1080), strychnine, and thallium sulfate, and the anticoagulants coumafuryl, pindone, and isovaleryl indandione (e.g., Pival) are either no longer registered, used rarely, or are no longer used in most commensal rodent programs because of the more efficarious and/or less hazardous modern rodenticides.  Thus, these compounds will not be discussed in the edition.  Also, the rodenticides used in other countries, but not registered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for commercial use in the U.S. are also not discussed.  Readers interested in the early rodenticides should consult earlier editions of the Handbook of Pest Control.  In-detail discussions on old and new rodenticides used around the world are provided by Meehan (1984), Prakash (1988) and Buckle and Smith (1994).<p>

<p><strong>Anticoagulants.</strong>  The anticoagulant rodenticides comprise about 90% or more of the baits used by pest management professionals.  Anticoagulant rodenticides cause death as a result of internal bleeding which occurs as the animal's blood loses its clotting ability and capillaries are destroyed.  The active ingredients are used a low levels of from 25 ppm to 50 ppm.  All anticoagulant rodenticides are relatively slow-acting; death ranges from three days to 10 days following the ingestion of a lethal amount of bait depending on the particular active ingredient.  Bait shyness does not occur with anticoagulant rodenticides.  Because of the addition of more advanced anticoagulants are now classified as first-generation and second-generation anticoagulants.<p>
