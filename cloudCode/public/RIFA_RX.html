IMPORTED FIRE ANTS. </b></font></font><font face="Chalkboard, serif">
“Total elimination of fire ants from a single property is possible
for a short period, but the ants usually quickly reinvade.  Regular
inspections and treatments are necessary to keep them at a minimum
level.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Chalkboard, serif">Texas
A&amp;M University and its extension service have devised “The
Two-Step Method” for fire ant control (Merchant and Drees 1992). 
This method is a simple approach that can effectively control RIFAs
when applied once or twice a year.  It includes a broadcast
application of baits followed by treatments of individual mounds with
residual insecticides. </font>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Chalkboard, serif">Step
1 involves broadcasting a slow-acting granular bait, then leaving
colonies undisturbed for several days, giving the foragers time to
bring the bait into the nest distribute it to all the workers, brood,
and queens.  Broadcast treatments can control colonies even when
their mounds are not visible.  Step 2 is to apply a properly labeled,
fast-acting residual product to the mounds.  Formulations for mound
treatments include dusts, liquid concentrates, and granules that are
watered into the mound.  These methods destroy ants quickly.  Hedges
(1998) reported fire ants in lawns can be controlled by applying both
these steps on the same day.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#1f497d"><font face="Chalkboard, serif"><b>BAITS.</b></font></font><font face="Chalkboard, serif">
 Most fire ant baits consist of insecticides on processed corn grits
coated with soybean oil.  For best results, fresh baits should always
be used and applied when the ground and grass are dry and no rain is
expected or watering planned for 48 hours.  Baits should be
broadcasted when the workers are foraging outside the nest.  In the
summer, when temperatures exceed 95*F (30*C), baits are more
effective when applied later in the day when it is cooler and the
ants are more active.  Baits can be applied with hand-held seed
spreaders with the spreader set on the smallest aperture.  The
applicator should make one or more passes over the treatment site at
a normal walking speed to apply the label recommended rate.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#1f497d"><font face="Chalkboard, serif"><b>DUSTS.
</b></font></font><font face="Chalkboard, serif"> Dusts should be
distributed evenly over the mound.  Ants walking through the treated
soil pick up dust particles on their bodies and transport the
insecticide into the mound.  Control of the colony usually results
within a few days.</font></p>

DRENCHING.</b></font></font><font face="Chalkboard, serif">  A number
of water-based products are labeled for application to fire ant
mounds and are applied to the mound as drenches.  They must be
applied in sufficient quantities to penetrate the entire nest,
ranging from a few ounces for small, newly formed mounds to 1 or 2
gallons for large, mature mounds.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#1f497d"><font face="Chalkboard, serif"><b>GRANULES.</b></font></font><font face="Chalkboard, serif">
 The active ingredient in a granular insecticide is released after
water is poured on it.  Granules should be spread on top and around
the mound, and then sprinkled with one to two gallons of water.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#1f497d"><font face="Chalkboard, serif"><b>NONCHEMICAL
OPTION.</b></font></font><font face="Chalkboard, serif">  Boiling
water (about 3 gallons per mound) will eliminate approximately 60% of
the nests treated, but it can be hazardous to the person transporting
the hot water.  The objective is to get the hot water deep into the
nest.  This method works best on cool, sunny days when the ants are
in the upper portion of the mound.”</font></p>
