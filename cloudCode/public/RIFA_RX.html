<h5>NOTE:  It is against company policy and practices to do widespread applications of pesticides.  Ant baiting should occur in bait stations or cracks and crevices.</h5><p>

<p><strong>RED IMPORTED FIRE ANTS.</strong>  “Total elimination of fire ants from a single property is possible for a short period, but the ants usually quickly reinvade.  Regular inspections and treatments are necessary to keep them at a minimum level.<p>

Texas A&M University and its extension service have devised “The Two-Step Method” for fire ant control (Merchant and Drees 1992).  This method is a simple approach that can effectively control RIFAs when applied once or twice a year.  It includes a broadcast application of baits followed by treatments of individual mounds with residual insecticides.<p> 

Step 1 involves broadcasting a slow-acting granular bait, then leaving colonies undisturbed for several days, giving the foragers time to bring the bait into the nest distribute it to all the workers, brood, and queens.  Broadcast treatments can control colonies even when their mounds are not visible.  Step 2 is to apply a properly labeled, fast-acting residual product to the mounds.  Formulations for mound treatments include dusts, liquid concentrates, and granules that are watered into the mound.  These methods destroy ants quickly.  Hedges (1998) reported fire ants in lawns can be controlled by applying both these steps on the same day.<p>

<p><strong>BAITS.</strong>  Most fire ant baits consist of insecticides on processed corn grits coated with soybean oil.  For best results, fresh baits should always be used and applied when the ground and grass are dry and no rain is expected or watering planned for 48 hours.  Baits should be broadcasted when the workers are foraging outside the nest.  In the summer, when temperatures exceed 95*F (30*C), baits are more effective when applied later in the day when it is cooler and the ants are more active.  Baits can be applied with hand-held seed spreaders with the spreader set on the smallest aperture.  The applicator should make one or more passes over the treatment site at a normal walking speed to apply the label recommended rate.<p>

<p><strong>DUSTS.</strong>  Dusts should be distributed evenly over the mound.  Ants walking through the treated soil pick up dust particles on their bodies and transport the insecticide into the mound.  Control of the colony usually results within a few days.<p>

<p><strong>MOUND DRENCHING.</strong>  A number of water-based products are labeled for application to fire ant mounds and are applied to the mound as drenches.  They must be applied in sufficient quantities to penetrate the entire nest, ranging from a few ounces for small, newly formed mounds to 1 or 2 gallons for large, mature mounds.<p>

<p><strong>GRANULES.</strong>  The active ingredient in a granular insecticide is released after water is poured on it.  Granules should be spread on top and around the mound, and then sprinkled with one to two gallons of water.<p>

<p><strong>NON-CHEMICAL OPTION.</strong>  Boiling water (about 3 gallons per mound) will eliminate approximately 60% of the nests treated, but it can be hazardous to the person transporting the hot water.  The objective is to get the hot water deep into the nest.  This method works best on cool, sunny days when the ants are in the upper portion of the mound.”<p>
