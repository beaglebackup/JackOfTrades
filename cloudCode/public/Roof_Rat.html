<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Roof
rats nest in vegetation like trees or ivy and in structures,
typically the upper portions of buildings. In buildings they are
typically found in wall voids and false ceilings. In the absence of
vegetation, they will burrow in the ground. Nests are typically round
and filled with shredded materials, vegetation or cloth. Roof rats
keep a territory of about 100 to 300 feet. Because of their daily
water requirements. </font>

 </b></font></font><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Unlike Norway
rats, they have a slender body that is 6 /12 to 8 inches long. Their
tale is longer than their bodies, typically 7 1/2 to 10 inch long
tail, as opposed to Norway rats that have tails shorter than their
body length. They weigh about 6 to 12 ounces. Roof rats range in
color from black to brownish gray and have a lighter underside. Roof
rats are very adept climbers. </font>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font color="#4f81bd"><font face="Avenir Book, serif"><b>LIFE
CYCLE.  </b></font></font><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Female roof
rats come into heat every 4-5 days. Once impregnated, the gestation
period lasts 21-23 days. They give birth to 5-8 pups per litter.
Females can mate again 24-48 hours after giving birth, leading to
several generations to be born per year. The youngâ€™s eyes and ears
open at 12-14 days old and they reach sexual maturity at 3 months
old. The average lifespan of wild rats is about 6 months, although
they can survive longer in ideal conditions. </font>

CONCERNS.  </b></font></font><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Roof
rats leave 25,000 droppings per year, which leads for a high
likelihood for contamination. Pathogens they carry include the
typhus, Weil's disease, toxoplasmosis and trichinosis. They also can
host other parasites like fleas or mites that may cause human harm or
spread other diseases like the bubonic plague. </font>
