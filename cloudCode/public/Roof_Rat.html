<h1>Roof
Rat </h1>
<h2>(Rattus
rattus)</h2>

<p><strong>Background Information.</strong> Also
known as black rats, Alexandria rats, fruit rats and ship rats, roof
rats are considered the most common rat. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Distribution &amp; Habits.</strong> The
roof rat originated in India Southeast Asia and from there were
spread to Europe through the extension of the Roman Empire. They
prefer tropical and semitropical climates especially those on the
Pacific coast, Hawaii, and the Southeastern United States. 
</p>

<p>Roof
rats nest in vegetation like trees or ivy and in structures,
typically the upper portions of buildings. In buildings they are
typically found in wall voids and false ceilings. In the absence of
vegetation, they will burrow in the ground. Nests are typically round
and filled with shredded materials, vegetation or cloth. Roof rats
keep a territory of about 100 to 300 feet. Because of their daily
water requirements. 
</p>

<p><strong>Identification.</strong> Unlike Norway
rats, they have a slender body that is 6 /12 to 8 inches long. Their
tale is longer than their bodies, typically 7 1/2 to 10 inch long
tail, as opposed to Norway rats that have tails shorter than their
body length. They weigh about 6 to 12 ounces. Roof rats range in
color from black to brownish gray and have a lighter underside. Roof
rats are very adept climbers. 
</p>

<p><strong>Life Cycle.</strong> Female roof
rats come into heat every 4-5 days. Once impregnated, the gestation
period lasts 21-23 days. They give birth to 5-8 pups per litter.
Females can mate again 24-48 hours after giving birth, leading to
several generations to be born per year. The youngâ€™s eyes and ears
open at 12-14 days old and they reach sexual maturity at 3 months
old. The average lifespan of wild rats is about 6 months, although
they can survive longer in ideal conditions. 
</p>

<p><strong>Feeding Behavior.</strong> Roof
rats are nocturnal, searching for food at night. They are omnivores,
and will scavenge from humans as well as eat fruit, vegetation,
grains, seeds, snails, pet food and trash. They consume 1/2 to 1
ounce of food per day and an 1 to 2 ounces of water daily. Rats are
neophobic and avoid new food items within their environment. 
</p>

<p><strong>Health Concerns.</strong> Roof
rats leave 25,000 droppings per year, which leads for a high
likelihood for contamination. Pathogens they carry include the
typhus, Weil's disease, toxoplasmosis and trichinosis. They also can
host other parasites like fleas or mites that may cause human harm or
spread other diseases like the bubonic plague.
