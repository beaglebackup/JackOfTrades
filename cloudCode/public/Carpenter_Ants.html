<h1>Carpenter Ants</h1>
<h2>Camponotus species</h2>
<h2>Subfamily Formicinae</h2>

<p><strong>Identifying Characteristics.</strong> 
Carpenter Ants have a one-segmented petiole in the form of a vertical
scale, and a terminal acidopore with a circular orifice fringed with
hairs.  The workers are polymorphic and characterized by their evenly
convex thoracic dorsum.</p>

<p><strong>Distribution.</strong>
 Various species of carpenter ants are distributed throughout the
U.S. ranging from sea level to higher than 9,000 feet.</p>

<p><strong>Biology &amp; Habits.</strong> 
Carpenter ants enter buildings to nest or forage.  They are called
“carpenters” because they excavate their nests in wood, creating
smooth tunnels and galleries.  They generally excavate in wood that
is decayed or damaged by other insects.  Fowler (1986), however,
stated, that carpenter ants are more often found in wood that is
structurally sound.</p>

<p>Carpenter
ant colonies are established after the mating flights of winged male
and female reproductive (Hansen and Akre 1985).  The nuptial flights
usually begin during the first warm days of spring.  After mating,
the males die.  In most species, the colonies are monogyne and begin
from a single queen.  She often starts the nest in a small cavity in
a dead or live tree where she lays her first eggs.  In tow to three
weeks, the eggs hatch into larvae that are fed by the queen.  At the
end of larval development, they pupate and later emerge as minor
workers, numbering 10 to 25 individuals.  The minors begin foraging,
excavating, and brood rearing for the colony.</p>

<p>In
two years, a population of workers ranging in size from small minors
to large majors will be present.  In three to five years, colonies of
C. pennsulvanicus start producing alates (Pricer 1908).  Populations
of ant colonies can reach tremendous numbers.  
</p>

<p>Mature,
or parent colonies, establish satellite colonies nearby whenever a
need exists for more territory, more resources, or a drier, warmer
nesting site for development of their larvae and pupae.  The queen,
workers, and small larvae are always present in the parent colony
whereas the satellite colonies contain workers, larger larvae, and
pupae (Hansen and Akre 1990).  Except during the winter diapause,
workers travel between the various satellites of a colony on
well-defined trails. 
</p>

<p>Parent
colonies containing the queen, workers, winged reproductive, and
larvae over-winter in a metabolic state termed diapause.  In
temperate regions, diapause is a period of dormancy during which the
ants are in a state of “suspended animation.”  The encasing wood
of the colony’s residence provides them with insulation from cold
temperatures.  In addition, larvae, workers, and reproductive have
glycerol, a compound that acts as anti-freeze (Cannon and Fell 1992).</p>

<p>In
temperate regions, colonies break diapause from January to June
(depending upon the latitude, elevation, and habitat), and the queen
begins her first egg-laying of the season, lasting for seven to 10
days (Hansen and Akre 1985, 1990).  The voracious appetites of the
developing larvae trigger increased foraging activity.  The most
intense foraging of the season is due to the increasing food
requirements of the rapidly developing larvae.  A second peak of
activity occurs in June when the queen again lays eggs for a period
of seven to ten days.  The foraging activity in the second peak is
shorter and less intense.   The colony enters into diapause in
September or October along with the late summer brood, which
overwinter as larvae and complete development in February.  Colonies
are perennial and may exist for more than 20 years.</p>

<p>Since
carpenter ants are primarily nocturnal, they rely heavily on physical
cues and chemical trails for orientation to and from the nest. 
Well-maintained physical trails and trunk lines of carpenter ants
serve as roadways through vegetation and debris.  In extreme northern
latitudes, carpenter ant trails will often travel underground
following natural hollows, such as those left by decaying tree roots
in the soil.  These tunnels are usually 1.5 to 3.0 centimeters in
diameter and may be as deep as 1 meter below the surface (Hansen and
Akre  1985).  The distance traveled to obtain food varies.  
</p>

<p>In
structural infestations of carpenter ants, the parent colony is
generally located outside in a tree, stump, stack of firewood, or
landscape logging.  In a tree, nests are frequently located in
hollows or dead limbs.  Satellite colonies may be found in similar
sites in one ore more neighboring trees and in adjacent structures. 
Such colonies may be found in a variety of places, including attic
rafters, roof overhangs, bay windows, fascia boards, floor joists,
box headers, wall voids, hollow curtain and shower rods, hollow doors
or columns, behind dishwashers, under or behind insulation in attics
and crawlspaces, bath traps, under cabinets, and in ceiling voids
next to skylights and chimneys.  A parent colony found inside is
typically associated with a water leak or other constant source of
moisture.</p>
