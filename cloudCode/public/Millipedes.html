<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“<font face="Avenir Book, serif">Back
(1939a) studied millipedes, or “thousand leggers,” as household
pests. These creatures normally live outdoors where they feed on damp
and decaying wood and vegetable matter, as well as on tender roots
and green leaves on the ground.  Their slow-crawling, rounded bodies
have two pairs of legs on each body segment except for the  first
three which have but one pair of legs on each segment.  Many
millipede species protect themselves by means of glands that secrete
an unpleasant odor.  About 1,000 species of millipedes occur in the
United States, and an expert is required to distinguish between the
species.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">N.B.
Causey, an authority on millipedes described the life history of
millipedes in a letter to Arnold Mallis: “In brief, the life
history of most of them is as follows: fertilization is internal;
eggs are deposited in clusters in the soil, sometimes in a capsule
prepared from them by the female; the first larvae have three pairs
of legs in most species; the larvae pass through a series of molts;
during each molt the number of legs, and segments is increased; the
number of molts, legs and segments varying within the species. 
Usually there are from seven to 10 molts.  When sexual maturity is
reached, the molting is usually discontinued.  Many species reach
sexual maturity the second year; others spend four or five years in
the larval stage and then live several years after that.” 
Cloudsley-Thompason (1958) discusses the life history of millipedes
in some detail.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">According
to Back (1939a), the tow species most annoying to homeowners are
Parajulus venustus Wood and P. impressus (Say).  They are brownish, 1
to 1.5 inch (25 to 38 mm) long, nocturnal, and hide during the day
beneath the various objects are located on damp soil.</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">For
the most parts, invasions of millipedes are limited to one to a few
individual.  For some reasons, yet unknown, masses of millipedes will
begin “migrations” that bring hundreds, even thousands into yards
and onto and into homes and other buildings.  Often, these migrations
occur during the fall; however, spring and summer migrations have
been encountered.  Some of the older reports of millipede migrations
are remarkable.  Brooks (1919) on the genus Fontaria in West
Virginia: “Mr. McDougle stated that on the morning following the
coming of the army to his home he opened a screen door between his
kitchen and back porch and that the door on swinging back swept up a
heap of millipedes a foot in height.  He immediately got a hovel and
cleaned up two wash tubs full from the porch and from a small ditch
that extended along the side.  Every morning thereafter for two weeks
her collected ½ bushel or more about his home and carried them
away.”</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">A
millipede epidemic was reported by Arnold Mallis in November in
western Pennsylvania.  Small millipedes, ½ to 1 inch (13 to 25 mm)
in length, later determined as Iulus, were by the hundreds climbing
the walls of houses and invading the houses themselves.  The epidemic
occurred during a period of unusually warm weather for that time of
the year, the temperature rising above 75*F during the day.  A cold
snap on November 18 immediately ended complaints on homeowners.</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Snetsinger
(1967) noted 90% of the millipedes that invaded buildings in central
Pennsylvania were Uroblaniulus jersey Causey.  He wrote about this
invasion as follows: “In October, U. jersey did not come out until
shortly after sunset.  At first, the millipedes were observed
crawling in the forest cover debris and grass.  Quickly they migrated
to the trunks of trees, walls of dwellings, etc.  Often 20 to 30
millipedes could be collected on a tree trunk during times of heavy
migration.  They climbed up the tree trunks to the height maximum. 
The millipedes remained on the trunk for four to six hours on the
nights during the study.  Toward morning, the millipedes migrated
down the tree trucks and walls into the soil where they spent the
daylight hours.  The following night, the same procedure occurred. 
Mating apparently occurs when the millipedes are on the tree trunks
and walls into the soil where they spent the daylight hours.  The
following night, the same procedure occurred.  Mating apparently
occurs when the millipedes are on the tree trunks or on the walls. 
The millipedes overwinter in the soil near the foundations of
dwellings and under debris near the trunks of trees.  Invasions of
dwellings appear to be accidental, associated with the search for a
humid site for overwintering.  In most basements, millipedes replace
those that die if the weather is warm enough so that millipedes
remain active through the evenings.”</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Bennett
and Kerr (1973) noted the two most important millipede pests in
Florida were the greenhouse millipede, Oxidus garcilis Koch, and the
tropical millipede, Orthomorpha coarctata (Saussure).  The greenhouse
millipede breeds in decaying leaf litter and the tropical millipede
in lawn grass thatches.  These species were found to be nocturnal.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Smith
(1982) discussed the desert millipedes, Orthoporous ornatus, a
species frequently encountered in the lower Sonoran Desert.  Desert
millipedes grow 4-1/2 inches (11.5 cm) and are most visible in
Arizona after summer rains, when they migrate by the thousands across
roads.</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Certain
species, such as the desert millipede, have glands that secrete an
irritating mixture of hydrocyanic acid, iodine, and quinone.  Smith
(1982) reported that it is “probably toxic to small animals and can
cause vesicular dermatitis (blistering of the skin) in humans.” 
Some tropical species can discharge their “venom” as a spray.”</font></p>
