<p><strong>Fecal Identification &amp; Evaluation.</strong>  "Fecal pellets, or droppings, are the most commonly encountered sign during a rodent inspection, and therefore serve as the primary evidence that a rodent infestation exists.  Feces are also the primary indication to clients in homes and businesses that rodents are present.<p>

Because feces can be one the keys for species identification, as well as provide clues to the relative abundance of rodents and other animal pests, correctly identifying scats is important.  Occasionally, it can be difficult to determine the difference between Norway rat feces and roof rats, based on feces alone, and other factors must be considered.<p>

Several characteristics should be considered when attempting to identify an animal scat: (1) shape, (2) length, (3) color, (4) consistency, and (5) general makeup (hair, insect, fragments, seeds, etc.).  Keep in mind that significant variations in size, color, shape, and texture occur among all scats according to the animal's age and diet.  Some rats in particular will occasionally produce feces significantly longer than those described in the textbooks.  When identifying feces, it is best to evaluate feces in groups, and not individual feces.  The location the feces are found at also provide important clues as to the pest's identity.<p>

The house mouse produces about 40 to 100 fecal pellets daily.  Even a small colony of mice in a building can produce thousands of feces in a short period of time.  Mouse fecal pellets measure between 1/8 to 1/4 inch (3 mm to 7mm) long, and have usually one - and sometimes both - ends pointed.  Sometimes, several droppings will be deposited in a string containing up to six or more pellets connected together especially by young mice.  The deer mouse that invades attics, garages, storage sheds, and summer cottages, produces feces very similar to those of the house mouse.<p>

The Norway rat produces about 40 to 50 feces daily.  These feces are the largest of the commensal rodents, ranging up to 3/4 inch (19 mm) long and 1/4 inch (7 mm) in diameter.  Most Norway rat feces are often found in small groups, while those of the roof rat are more scattered.  Feces grouping may play a role in food preference communication to other members of the rat colony (Laland and Plotkin 1991).  The roof rat produces feces often similar in appearance to Norway rat feces, but generally they are a more curved, sausage shape, and the adult's fecal pellet typically measures about 1/2 inch (13 mm) in length, although they may be up to 3/4 inch (19 mm) in length.<p>

Still it can be misleading to try to differentiate rat species by the shape of feces alone.  Huson and Davis (1980) developed discriminate functions to aid in identifying and distinguishing between the feces pellets of these two rats.<p>

The color of most rodent feces normally ranges among difference shades of browns and blacks.  But it is common to find a wide range of colors depending on the particular account varying from bright red (mice eating paprika) to all the colors available within a account varying from bright red (mice eating paprika) to all the colors available within a Crayola box that the mice have been consumed (Frishman 1974).  During some baiting programs, feces are often found to be green - reflecting the color of the bait used.  In milling plants, the fecal pellets may be covered with flour dust, rendering them white or a light brown.<p>

A common characteristic of rodent feces is the presence of hair that is ingested during grooming.  Bullard and Shuyler (1983) reported that a single rat dropping could contain as many as 200 hair fragments.  Be aware, however, that hair fragments are also found in the feces of other animals as well.  If positive species identification is required, the hair can be microscopically identified as explained by Vazquez (1961).<p>

The scats found in a building can be used for more than just identifying the presence and species of rodent.  Feces can provide a professional a roadmap to the so very critical high-activity areas of the rodents such as the primary runways, preferred corners, food sources, and the rodent's harborages.  The size and quantity of fresh feces found in a given area can help indicate the number of rodents present.  A few fresh feces of different sizes indicate that at least one ray or mouse is present.  Many fresh feces of different sizes indicate that both young and old individuals (e.g., a breeding population) are present.<p>

Most feces deposited on floors become hard within several hours, although in humid or moist environments feces may remain soft for several days.  Pratt and Brown (1982) provided a good description of "new" and "old" feces.  Feces that have been recently deposited (within a few hours or less), are usually soft enough to be pressed out of shape, have a putty-like consistency, and often have a glistening, moist appearance.  Old feces appear dull or grayish and may disintegrate easily when pressed.  Some feces, however, may be black and shiny and still be hand and crumbly.  Similarly, old feces may be moistened by rain or humidity and may appear fresh.<p>

Feces on the floor of a flour mill or bakery will collect flour dust and appear dry, brittle, and whitish.  yet, they may have been deposited the night before.  So again, noting and analyzing the location of the feces is important.  By noting the abundance of old and new feces, some indication can be obtained as to how long the infestation has been present.<p>

The presence of only old feces, even in large numbers, does not necessarily mean the area is currently infested.  As a general rule, when only old feces are found, other signs should be investigated to confirm rodent infestation.<p>

Perhaps the most practical method for determining the status of an infestation and the location of high-activity areas is to remove available feces and upon reinspection, note the presence and locations of any new feces.  Still, the absence of feces does not always indicate the absence of rodents.  Sometimes, with minor rat infestations - especially roof rats - fecal pellets may not be found even when it has been confirmed that rats are active in an area.  Rats are known to ingest their own fecal pellets (coprophagy).  Too, rats sometimes deposit their feces in out-of-sight locations.  Also in the floors in a building are swept often and stored goods are moved regularly, rodent feces may be swept away or even moved to areas where rodents are actually not present.<p>

<p><strong>Runways, Tracks, and Grease Marks.</strong>  Rodent runways are usually evident in rat and mouse infestations because rodents repeatedly use the same pathways between their nests and found sources.<p>

Runways are easier to detect with Norway rats than for mice or roof rats.  Outdoors, fresh runways of rats are smooth, well packed, and free of vegetation.  Indoors, runways along floors or rafters are identified by clean paths through dust or dirt.  Grease marks (or rub marks) from the oil and dirt of rats and mice often appear along wall areas next to runways.  Grease marks may also occur around bottoms of joists where rodents have been traveling along beams or sill plates, on stairways, or around burrow opening in walls, floors, or ceilings.<p>

Tracks from rodents are sometimes seen in dusty areas or outside in the mud near water puddles.  The presence of tracks during an inspection is usually a strong indication of an active infestation, because most tracks are not likely to remain visible for long before they are either swept, washed, or blown away.  Track marks can be used to indicate the presence of rats or mice.  The size of a rodent track is the key identifying character.  Usually, the hind foot track is the most visible because this is where most of the weight is placed as the animal travels about.  Rat tracks are relatively large, measuring between 3/4 inch to 1.25 inch (2.0 to 4.0 cm).  The mouse's hind foot track is considerably smaller, measuring only about 3/8 to 3/4 inch (1.0 to 1.9 cm).  (Note: these sizes are representative of the size of the track, not the length of the hind feet.)  Counting toe prints is not especially helpful because both rats and mice have four toes on the front feet and five toes on the hind foot.<p>

Rats and mice may also leave "tail drag" marks which will appear as a thin line between their foot prints.  Typically, it is the older rodents that drag their tails the most.  The tail drag of a rat is about 4 to 5 mm in width; the mouse's tail drag measure only about 2 mm.<p>

USPHS (1948) recommended testing for tracks by sprinkling a thin layer of nontoxic dust, not more than 1/16 inch (1.6 mm) thick, over a small area on floors, shelves, beams, and any other site where rodents have been known to travel or are likely to use as runways.  The dust can be applied with a large can having several openings punched in its top.  If any rodents are present on the premises, positive evidence should be found the next morning by inspecting the dust for tracks.  Because flour may attract insects and be used by the rodents as a food source, ordinary talcum powder is the preferred tracking powder.  Unscented "dry" spray deodorants also may be used, and these work especially well inside plastic bait boxes.  Kaukeinen (1979) developed a spray technique using powdered chalk and alcohol to thinly coat floor tiles for use in measuring tracking activity.<p>

<p><strong>Gnawing Damage.</strong>  Evidence of recent gnawing and/or damage as a result of gnawing is an excellent sign for determining the presence of rodents.  In fact, the meaning of the word "rodent" is "to gnaw."  Rodents possess a pair of incisors that grow constantly at the rate of 0.3 to 0.4 mm per day.  But contrary to popular belief, rodents do not need to gnaw on objects to keep their incisors filed down.  This is accomplished by grinding the upper and lower incisors against each other.<p>

By examining the size of the two shallow, parallel grooves left by the incisors on the gnawed object, it can be determined whether the marks are from rats or mice.  The incisors of mice leave a mark 1 to 2 mm wide, while the mark left by rats or mice.  The incisors of mice leave a mark 1 to 2 mm wide, while the mark left by rats measures about 3.5 to 4.0 mm in width.<p>

Rodents may gnaw on many difference objects within their activity range, including aluminum, mortar, plastic, lead, and any other items softer than the enamel of their incisors.  Rodents seem especially fond of gnawing on electrical wires found throughout buildings.  For this reason alone rodents can be extremely important pests in office complexes, schools, banks, and any building where computers and other valuable electronic machines critical for everyday operations are housed.<p>

Rats commonly gnaw on wooden structural members, such as door corners, floor and ceiling joists, and wall studs.  Wood recently gnawed upon will have a light colored, rough, and splintered appearance.  Wood shavings are usually evident below the damaged area.  Over time, the gnawed area darkens, and the rodents will continue to gnaw the spot until it is smooth with rounded edges.  When rats gnaw holes into cartons and boxes, the holes typically measure about 2 inches (5.1 cm) or more in diameter, and often contain rough, torn edges.<p>

Mice gnaw on wires, plastic items, cardboard, waxy substances, and wood.  In homes, mice shred paper and gnaw holes in the corners of food boxes and bags.  Mouse damage holes are typically small, clean-cut holes about 1.5 inches (4.0 cm) in diameter.  In bathrooms, mice often gnaw on bar soap stored in cabinets.<p>

<p><strong>Burrows.</strong>  Burrows are an obvious sign when dealing with the Norway rat in outdoor infestations.  Rat burrows measure about 3 inches (7.5 am) in diameter and may be found next to walls, along foundations, or beneath debris or shrubbery.  Around the outside of residences, two of the most common areas are always prime suspects.<p>

Active rat burrows are usually clear of vegetation, and the burrow entrance appears compacted and smooth.  In some instances, fresh soil will have been recently kicked out of the burrow.  To verify an active burrow, cave the burrow in with dirt and recheck the burrows the following day.  Ashton et al. (1984) and Jackson (1979) described using the activity or rat burrows as a measure for evaluating rodenticide efficacy.<p>

House mice occupying exterior areas near buildings typically do not burrow unless conditions are right and a suitable food source (e.g., bird seed) is nearby.  Mouse burrows measure about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter.  Within large commercial structures such as food plants, warehouses and the contemporary super "mart-style" stores, it is not uncommon for mice to access the fill beneath the slabs via the expansion joints and construct burrows and tunnels in the fill.  Hen these mice go unnoticed for prolonged periods, it can result in especially larger than those of rats around structures are likely to be those of ground squirrels, chipmunks, or ground hogs.<p>

<p><strong>Urine Stains &amp; Odors.</strong>  Rodent urine is usually deposited on rodent runways and other areas the rodents frequent.  As a result, rodent odors are often detectable in well-established infestations as both rats and mice produce characteristic odors from their urine and various body glands.  Experienced pest management professionals are capable of discerning the urine between each of the three commensal rodents.  In large mouse for prolonged periods.  In some cases, rats and mice consistently urinate and defecate in particular spots that become conspicuous even without the use of black light illumination (Meehan 1984; Frantz and Davis 1991).<p>

<p><strong>Black light Inspections.</strong>  Under ultraviolet light, rodent urine will fluoresce yellow on burlap bags and pale, blue-white on various packaging paper.  Thus, black lights are often considered as tools to inspect for rodent urine contamination on packages.  However, skill is required when using black lights because other items such as bleached sack fibers, optical bleaches, packaging glues and adhesive, dyes, and some cleaning agents also fluoresce.  The key to an accurate diagnosis when using black lights is to first notice the pattern of the area fluorescing.  Because rodents often urinate while moving, their patterns appear as a line of tine drops or streaks, whereas chemical spills or florescent food items tend to be large patchy areas, or uniformly spread out.<p>

In the food industry, product suspected of being contaminated should not be rejected based only for one pallet or package showing a positive fluoresce, as this may result in very expensive rejection of materials which, in fact, may not be contaminated at all by rodent urine.  Holcomb (2002) presented a valid argument for questioning the practicality of using black lights for food product inspections, because so many items flouresce.  Black lights can serve as a fist possible indicator of rodent contamination or activity.  But, a further, detailed inspection should always be conducted for other signs of rodent contamination.  When a flourescing area is located, and rodents are suspected, a verification test for urea should be conducted by a qualified lab.<p>

Black lights can also be used as a specialty tool to assist in identifying possible rodent entry areas into buildings, or their runways along floors, rafters and so forth.<p>

<p><strong>Rodent Sightings and sounds.</strong>  Observing live or undecomposed dead rodents during an inspection is certainly a confirmation of an infestation.  But as stressed earlier, rodents are typically nocturnal and/or tend to be secretive.  Generally, if rodents are seen regularly during the day in difference locations, it indicates a heavy infestation.  A night inspection can also be conducted to quickly confirm the level of the infestation.  Most rodents in urban environments and inside buildings become active within one or two hours after sunset or when the sounds of human activity subside.  However, later and earlier times may be the peak activity periods of a particular rodent colony depending on the specific local conditions.<p>

Various sounds produced by rodents and their young such as high-pitched squeaks, gnawing sounds, scratching, diffing, and sounds of rodents fighting can be heard if an inspection is conducted quietly by the pest management professional.  With rats, the best time to hear their sounds is during a night inspection.  Rats and mice (including the elusive deer mouse) hiding in walls and structural voids can often be detected using a stethoscope or a listening device.<p>

<p><strong>Miscellaneous methods &amp; estimating rodent numbers.</strong>  Because rodents often utilize secluded spots near runways or tunnels as eating areas, piles of food residues (nut shells, seeds, indigestible parts of food items, etc.) may accumulate in these areas and be indicative of an infestation.  Also, cats and dogs may excitedly sniff and probe an area where rats or mice are present and often indicate this be scratching or making unusual sounds.<p>

Pest management professionals are always queried by property owners as to "how many rodents are infesting my building?"  But other than "on-the-job guesstimates" (e.g., "a few," "not too many," or "a lot"), it is difficult or impractical for the professional to attempt to estimate rodent numbers with any degree of accuracy.  Generally, when rodent signs are fresh and found in abundance, it can be assumed a heavy population is present.  When the signs are old and few in number, the infestation may consist of only one or a few rodents.<p>

In cases where there are clearly more than just a couple of rodents, it is better to overestimate the infestation.  Underestimating a rodent infestation often results in failure to place enough traps or baits which then may lead to a series of expensive callbacks, delayed results, and angry clients.<p>

A method of estimating rodent numbers and an important preliminary step in some baiting programs is the use of nontoxic bait.  Once the nontoxic bait is being accepted, a rat population can be estimated by measuring total consumption during a 24 hour period and dividing by 1/2 ounce (15 g.) However, movement and feeding patterns may affect the accuracy of such estimates.<p>

From a practical standpoint, what is more important than the actual number of rodents is how great a reduction in activity can be demonstrated.  Have fresh fecal pellets decreased by 75%?  Do 90% of the rodent burrows you closed remain closed?  Such an approach provides you with a practical way of evaluating a control program (Ashton et al. 1984).<p>

Corrigan (1991, 1997) provided details on conducting night inspections and the use of video cameras to detect the activity and whereabouts of elusive rats, as well as obtain infestation profiles as to whether or not the infestation is minor, moderate or severe.  Jackson (1992) provided excellent discussion debunking the media "hype" associated with the numbers of rats per person in cities.<p>

<h2>RODENT CENSUSING &AMP; MONITORING IN IPM PROGRAMS</h2>
Censusing is a process of using some technique (e.g., food consumed, number of rodents track in a patch, number of droppings per area, etc.) in an attempt to estimate the number of animals in a building and/or surrounding area or to assign some relative value representing the size of the population.  Monitoring, as it applies to the pest management  operations, is a process of keeping track of a pest population.<p>

When professionals conduct a basic rodent inspection and interview clients who have called because of a rodent problem, they are conducting an informal census of the population.  In these cases, the professional already knows rodents exist but wishes to estimate if the population is minor, moderate, or severe.  Realistically, the professional does not need to census further.<p>

But once control is achieved, the program can now be monitored to ensure correct management of any recurrence or re-invasion by rodents, as well as to provide the client with a regular report of the monitoring program.  This type of monitoring can be achieved using nontoxic foods or ready to use nontoxic bait blocks (e.g., Detex).  In rodent control, this type of monitoring translates to not needing to use rodenticides unless the non-toxic bait monitors indicate rodent activity.  For pesticide-sensitive facilities such as schools, fence rows at food processing facilities, and zoological parks, this strategy has obvious advantages in minimizing baiting hazards.<p>

On the other hand, monitoring with nontoxic baits is not a good fit for every situation.  For example, using bait monitors along the exterior fence rows of food plants is an excellent utility of the monitoring concept.  Inside the plant, however, visual inspections and rodent traps are the appropriate monitoring tools.  Obviously any rodent activity inside a food processing facility must be stopped immediately and the use of a bait monitoring program is not appropriate.<p>

<h2>NON-CHEMICAL RODENT MANAGEMENT</h2>
<strong>Rodent proofing (exclusion).</strong>  Rodent proofing is the process of denying rodents entry into buildings by improving the building's structural integrity.  Used in conjunction with effective and ongoing environmental sanitation programs, these tow practices provide the best long-term and cost effective component of any rodent IPM program.  Storer (1952) noted, "Exclusion is the real solution to rodent pest management.  All other methods give only temporary relief."  In a study by Douglas et al. (2003), relating to minimizing the chances of building occupants contracting hantavirus, these researchers demonstrated that unless a building is rodent proofed, exterior mice quickly occupy spaces inside buildings that become available when the previous mice are killed through control programs.<p>
Fundamentally, exclusion involves elimination of dead spaces, cracks, crevices, and other openings so that pests cannot hide in, enter, or leave a specific building, room, or piece of equipment (Scott 1991).<p>

Rodent proofing varies from the very simple to complex.  Unfortunately, many property owners (and pest management professionals) bypass even the simple rodent proofing situations in favor of repetitive trapping and baiting programs.  Perhaps it is because rodent-proofing efforts are perceived by the public (and pest management professionals) as too time consuming, costly, or requiring special expertise.<p>

Other factors working against rodent proofing include the results not being immediately obvious, and professionals cannot guarantee pests will not recur despite extensive rodent-proofing efforts.  In addition, many people are skeptical as to whether or not it is possible to exclude determined pests, and thus they feel perhaps that rodent proofing is money wasted.<p>

It is the author's opinion, however, that the future of professional-level pest exclusion programs and services is bright.  Forces which may create a better marketplace for pest-proofing services include the public's awakening to urban IPM, increasing litigation associated with pesticides and pesticide mishaps, a growing interest in the use of non-chemical solutions to pest problems, and further restrictions on the use of pesticides around people, pets, and wildlife.  Regardless, pest proofing is effective in eliminating recurring pest problems, and progressive companies that offer and practice pest-proofing programs usually provide strong testimony to the long-term results.  Kramer (2003) also presented excellent reasoning as to the value of the pest management professional advertising and selling rodent proofing as add-on services.<p>

The following discussion presents an overview of rodent proofing and is based on the classic early works of Silver et al. (1942), Storer (1952), USPHS (1948), and the Georgia DPH (1944).  Most of the recommendations in these publications are still very applicable today.  Additional information was gathered from Tarzwell (1953), Scott and Borom (1977), Jenson (1979), Frantz (1988), Scott (1991), Murphy and Todd (1993), and Baker et al. (1994).  The discussions as provided by Kaukeinen (1994), Meyer (1994), Smith (1994), and Corrigan (2001) also provide valuable insight and in some cases detailed discussion as to the importance of rodent proofing for long-term rodent pest management.<p>

USPHS (1948) noted that constant vigilance must be maintained to keep buildings rodent proofed.  Regardless of the cost or thoroughness, rodent proofing cannot be insured for a week or even for a day.  Within this time, door may be broken by a truck backing into it, a basement window may be broken, a worker may remove the rodent proofing or make a new opening, or in some other mechanical way a leak may be made through which rodents may reinfest a building that has been proofed.  This biological pressure is greatest during the first week or two after rodents have been sealed out of places in which they have been accustomed to feeding.<p>

A modern concrete and brick building can be rodent proofed with a minimum of alterations.  The following is a list of the more important entry avenues by rodents, as well as the means by which such openings may be closed.<p>
1.  Rats Often burrow beneath the foundations of buildings lacking basements.  Such buildings may be protected from rat entry placing a "curtain wall" or barrier of metal, concrete, or brick around and below the foundation of the building.  Vertical curtain walls 2 feet (0.6 m) below the surface of the ground with an 8-inch (20 cm) horizontal "L" or flange directed away from the building are usually effective.  Although rats may burrow deeper than these distances, the horizontal flange discourages them from doing so.  Corrugated iron sheets, 29-guage, as well as concrete, may also be used for this purpose.<p>
2.  Wooden doors are often gnawed through by rats.  Galvanized, 24-guage, sheet iron flashing around the bottom of the door, door sills, and jambs will prevent the entry of rats through tight-fitting doors.  No more than 3/8 inch (9.5 mm) clearance should be present between the door and sill.  Doors should be kept closed when not in use.  Similarly, wherever possible, all floors should be made of concrete, as rats can gnaw through wooden floors.<p>
3.  Openings around pipes passing through the wood siding can be covered with galvanized, 24-guage sheet iron flashing.  Bricks and cement can be used to close the vents around pipes passing through brick, stone, or cement walls.<p>
4.  Ventilator grills should be covered with 18-gauge, 1/2 inch (13 mm) mesh, galvanized, expanded metal or 16-guage, 1/2 inch (13 mm) mesh, galvanized wire cloth.  Low windows can be protected with 19-gauge, 1/2 inch (13 mm) mesh, galvanized wire cloth.<p>
5.  Sidewalk gratings should be closed with 18-gauge, 1/2 inch (13 mm) mesh, galvanized expanded metal.<p>
6.  Openings into hollow walls, particularly between the floor and floor-sills, should be closed with 19-guage, 1/2 inch (13 mm) mesh, galvanized wire cloth, or galvanized, 24-guage sheet iron.<p>
7.  Rats often travel inside defective drain pipes or burrow along such pipes.  A metal cover with small perforations should be cemented over the drain pipe in the floor, and openings around the drain where it enters the building should be patched with cement mortar.<p>
8.  Rats may burrow through large sidewalk cracks into a building.  These should be repaired with concrete.<p>
9.  Circular rat guards of galvanized metal should be placed around vertical wires and pipes to prevent rats from climbing upward.  Rats may wedge themselves between a drain and the wall and thus reach the upper stories of the house; a circular rat guard on the drain will prevent this.<p>
10.  A common avenue of entry for rodents (especially roof rats but even Norway rats) into the open eaves of an attic is via a tree limb touching the roof of the building.  Such limbs should be pruned back a minimum of six feet.<p>
11.  For mice, tightly packing coarse steel wool or copper mesh into a hole leading to the outdoors (for temporary blockage until permanent construction changes can be made) will stop mouse entry.  Plugging holes and confining mice to smaller areas can be made) will stop mouse entry.  Plugging holes and confining mice to smaller areas can enhance trapping programs.  An opening slightly more than 1/4 inch (6 mm) in diameter is extremely small, thereby requiring time to find and patch all possible holes.  Even if all such holes are plugged, mice can still enter hidden inside boxes or "scoot in" when somebody opens an exterior door.  Building materials as discussed for rats are applicable for mice.<p>

Despite sincere rodent-proofing efforts, rodents exhibit uncanny abilities in accessing structures.  So-called "rodent-proofed buildings" frequently become infested by rodents hiding inside pallets carried on forklifts, or by rodents moving from adjacent harborage when a door is opened.  Still, rodent-proofing efforts are essential for professional, long-term IPM programs, particularly where structures are located in neighborhoods where rodent pressure is constant.<p>

Sewers, utility tunnels, and other underground passageways (often unknown or forgotten) provide below-surface highways for rodents (especially rats) and access to otherwise rodent-proofed buildings.  Where combined sewers exist (e.g., sanitary and surface drainage collect together), the movement of rats from the surface into the underground labyrinth and then into buildings is facilitated.<p>

Rats dispersing from sewers and emerging through toilets is common throughout the U.S., mostly in the older sections of cities and towns.  Several years ago when St. Paul, Minn., separated the old combines sewer system, the new sanitary sewers, with the flow enriched from garbage grinders enclosed a growing rat population.  With the former exits to the surface storm drains closed off, the increasing numbers of rats moved up the sewer laterals into homes and commercial buildings through uncovered basement drains and toilets (Staphinson 1991).  Systematic poisoning programs in utility manholes using paraffin baits and covering or sealing basement drains and utility services are obvious responses to such situations.  (For excellent discussions on city sewer  baiting programs, refer to Colvin et al. 1998 and Kaukeinen 1992).<p>

Regarding rodent proofing of food handling facilities, Meyer (1994) stated, "The exact nature and range of proofing measures that can be applied will depend very much on the design of the store.  What is not in doubt is that the identification of proofing needs for a building should lie with the person responsible for rodent control at that site.  As the surveys and treatments are undertaken, proofing requirements should be noted.  Where proofing measures are relatively straightforward they are probably best under taken (e.g., filling holes with concrete) by the rodent control professional.  Where more substantial work is necessary, the details should be passed to the store manager who must be responsible for their rapid implementation."<p>

<p><strong>Rodent Traps.</strong>  Mechanical traps for rodent control include different styles and models.  The most common traps used today in the pest control industry are the snap traps, the multiple catch traps (mice), and glue traps.<p>

<p><strong>Snap Traps.</strong>  The common rodent snap trap is familiar to nearly everyone and is one of the oldest devices for controlling rodents.  In an effort to capitalize on Ralph Waldo Emerson's advice "if you build a better mousetrap, the world will beat a pathway to your door," inventors have been attempting to build a better trap for more than 140 years.  In fact, to date, approximately 3,500 mousetrap patents (and counting) have been awarded by the U.S. Patent Office.  Several different types of snap traps have evolved from the originals and are available to professionals and homeowners alike.<p>

Trapping is appropriate for those situations where the use of rodenticides is unwarranted or might pose a hazard.  Traps can also be used where the odor of the decomposing rodents might be unacceptable.  Using snap traps also has several disadvantages.  First, success with traps depends on the skill and determination of the trapper.  Second, trapping often requires more time and effort than some other methods of control.  Third, traps cannot be placed where children, pets, or unknowing feet wander.  Fourth, if not secured to a surface, a rodent caught by a tail or foot may drag the trap away.  And finally, once sprung, snap traps are ineffective until reset."<p>
