<strong>Snap traps for Mice.</strong>  "Mouse snap traps can be highly effective tools - especially when used by an experience professional.  Oderkirk (1938) provided when used by an experienced professional.  Oderkirk (1938) provided many useful tips for trapping mice in earlier editions of this handbook and these are still applicable today, in addition to new trapping strategies.<p>

1.  Tying the bait securely to the trigger prevents the rodent from licking or nibbling the bait without setting off the trigger.  If a bait is used that cannot be tied (e.g., chocolate syrup), it is best to use small amounts.<p>

2.  Sensitivity of the trap is adjusted by bending the long, narrow metal prong that touches the trigger.  In areas where vibrations are a problem, the trap must be made less senstive.<p>

3.  The key to success using mousetraps is to use many traps.  For only a couple of mice in a residence, 12 or more traps are not too many.<p>

4.  Traps shoudl be placed close together (approximately six-foot spacing) in double sets in areas of activity.<p>

5.  In situations where contamination is not a problem, traps can be reused after captures.  Odors from previous rodents will not repel mice and are sometimes more attractive to rodents.<p>

6.  The professional, expanded-triffer mouse traps should be used for best trapping results.<p>

7.  Trap baits can be varied.  The success of any bait depends largely upon how much other food is available and what the rodent is accustomed to eating.  Oatmeal, whole oats, salami, freshly fried bacon, and chocolate flavor extracts are but a few of the items that can be successful.  In areas with numerous mice, the use of a variety of baits (e.g., meats, fruit, candy, cereals, etc.) amoung all the traps may entice a wide range of the mice within the colony during any one trapping event.  Also, it may be a good strategy to use nuts in a meat packing facility and meat in a four mill, so the mice are offered a food that is not otherwise available.  Peanut butter and or nutmeats are also good baits provided they are not used in residents or other areas (e.g., schools, day care center) where there may be children or individuals with peanut allergies.<p>

8.  Effective baits are also small pieces of thread or cloth which mice use for nesting materials (dental floss is convenient to use and carry).  Female mice exhibit intensive nest building activity just prior to the onset of the cold weather and within a day or two of birthing a new litter (Bronson 1979).  Nesting material will not spoil, nor will it be consumed by ants or cockroaches.<p>

With the expanded traffer model snap trap (professional model), it is often possible to trap mice without using bait merely by placing the treadle in a position next to the wall where the rodent may step on it.  Corrigan and Weber (1991) showed that the professional model trap had a capture rate of 53% as compared to 37% for the standard trigger model.  Both models have been exhibited about equal "escape rates" (traps set off without any capture) of about 12% to 14%.  Also, bait stealing did not occur with the professional level trap, yet occured at a 16% rate with the standard trigger traps.<p>

Traps are effective when set next to a wall beneath a runway made by leaning a board against the wall.  The trigger end of the trap should be situated nest to the wall.  Several traps set together will prevent the rodents from jumping  over them.  Becasue rats can be neophobic of objects, traps should not be set directly in front of a hole where the rat gains entrance to the room.<p>

Old traps should be scraped and kept clean.  Dipping traps in melted paraffin lengthens wear, deodorizes them and may make them spring more readily.  One case proved very successful by placing traps inside discarded paper bags in which students had kept their lunches."<p>

<p><strong>Multiple-Catch Live Mouse Traps.</strong>  "Multiple-catch mouse traps (MCTs) are also known as "curiousity traps" and are now available in several brands comprised of two basic types: a wind-up trap, and a low profile trap-door trap.  One widing of the wind-up models permits the capture of numerous mice.  The trap door models offer a low-profile design and employ an entrance tunnel with a one-way trap door that allows a mouse to enter but not escape.  Both types of traps are made by different manufacturers; some are made of metal, some of plastic.  The greatest number of these traps are used in the food and warehousing industry, but they are also used in a wide variety of commercial facilities.  Specific details on MCTs and their use in the food industry were discussed by Corrigan (2001, 2003).  Multiple-catch traps are rarely used in residential settings.<p>

Mice enter MCTs as a result of their opportunistic behavior to investigate new holes and harborages they encounter in their travels.  Once trapped inside, the mice succumb to a loss of body heat (Hypothermia) and/or deprivation.  The amound of time required for a captured mouse to expire depends on ambient temperatures, the condition of the mouse, and whether or not any other mice are inside the trap (that can be used as food).<p>

To maximize results with multiple catch live traps, the following considerations and tips may prove helpful (Frishman 1981; Corrigan 1988, 2001).<p>

1.  No difference in capture rates has been found between the wind-up and nonwind-up model traps (Temme 1980; Corrigan 1988).  However, operational and design factors (high- or low-profile design, handling time, ease of infesting, cleaning, see-thru inspectiosn plates, etc.) should be evaluated to ensure selecting te trap of choice for the particular situation or needs of the pest management professional (Corrigan 1993).  Additionally, some models offer various advantages (e.g., escape prevention designs, construction design, etc.) for their specific brand.  Consequently, "comparative shopping" for best long-term value amount the different brands is important.<p>

2.  Metal traps are prone to rusting, warping and denting, resulting in gaps and warping at doors, hinges, and lids.  Such damage not only allows captured mice to escape but also renders the traps difficult to open and handle, and these traps are more liekly to be skipped by busy technicians.  Metal traps must be inspected regularly, and repaired or replaced as needed.<p>

3.  Items should be pulled away from walls to encourage mice to investigate the traps.<p>

4.  Washing the lids of some models will allow them to slide more easily.  This facilitates the technician cleaning the inside of the trap when it gets dirty and/or when removing dead rodents trapped inside.<p>

5.  WIth the wind-up models, the trap should be placed either parallel to the wall about 2 to 3 inches (50 to 76 mm) from the wall or perpendicular and flush to the wall.  No evidence exists that one position is clearly superior to the other.<p>

6.  Winding traps too tightly can break the winding mechanism, or cause the spring mechanism, or cause the spring mechanism to "spin out," rendering the trapp ineffective.  The Ketch-All trap offers a no-fault winding operation.<p>

7.  If a wind-up trap is wound halfway, the mice are "gently" flicked into the holding area.  This affords a better chance that the mouse will remain alive for several hours.  Although no scientific evidence has proven this fact, it appears a live mouse in the trap attracts more mice than would a dead mouse.  However, it is known that recently wearned mice of a litter follow mom, or their sibling on feeding and exploring forays, and thus it is common to find entire litters and/or family units inside the trap during the course of one night of traping.  As many as 19 mice have been captured in a single multiple-catch trap in one night.<p>

8.  Traps should be located in the high activity runways of mice, on either side of doorways, and all other possible entry points (e.g., utility lines into a building).  For preventative programs in the food industry, the traps are usually installed along allocated spacings around the entire interior perimeter wall.<p>

9.  Around the exterior of food processing facilities, mouse control programs can be supplemented by placing multiple-catch live traps outdoors near entrances with the goal of trapping mice prior to their entry.  For long-term performance, exterior traps should be protected from dirt, dust, debris, and the elements. Plunkett's Exterminating Company of Minneapolis utilizes a "Mouse House: where the MCT is insalled inside a metal rat-sized bait station (O'Reilly 1995).<p>

10.  A putty knife, rags and wire brush are very effective for dry cleaning of multiple catch traps.<p>

11.  Tools such as a screwdriver and especially a needle-nose pliers are essential on-the-job repair tools.<p>

12.  Most food plants run MCTs weekly or more often in sensitive areas.  In food and pharmaceutical facilities, dead rodents, feces, and/or hair left in traps constitue a snaitary concern, and such traps should be checked frequently, and cleaned of an or all captured residents.<p>

13.  For facilities where contamination is not an issue, successful traps should not be thoroughly washed regularl because this removes the urine odor that is attractive to mice.  (unforturnately, a synthetic urine formulation does not exist to "pre-season" rodent traps.)<p>

14.  Inexpensive cardboard glue traps can be placed within the multiple-catch mouse traps.  This results in "trap synergy" (Corrigan 1996).  When glue traps and a multiple-catch trap are combined, this two-in-one trp now works as both a mousetrap, and an industrial strength monitoring station for both insects and rodents.  Moreoever, the glue trap effectively will contain the carcass, hair, and feces of the capture rodent, thereby reducing the biohazards and potential contaminants associated with trapped mice.  The body of the MCT in turn protects the glue trap from dust, dirt, and moisture.<p>

15.  Professionals sevicing MCTs should wear protective disposable gloves when cleaning traps that contain mouse carcasses or fecal material.  Many professionals prefer to wear leather work gloves while performing routine weekly servicing of metal brand MCTs to avoid cuts and abrasions.  Wearing a respirator (to protect against inhaling a microbial pathogen, such as hantavirus) is not necessary unless the multiple-catch traps are installed into areas where the deer mouse is prevalent.<p>

<p><strong>Glue Traps.</strong>  Glue traps have been a popular form of rodent trap in the U.S. and other countries (e.g., Japan) during the past 30 years.  As a result, glue trap technology has emerged producing several different forms and models of glue traps.  Traps are available in both mouse and rat sizes, as boards, or as trays, as scented or unscented traps, as covered or uncovered, and with glues that claim to offer superior capture in both warm and cold temperatures.  However, research data demonstrating efficacy for the various models or their use under different environmental and "real world" conditions in the U.S. is minimal.  Corrigan (1998) presented the results of field trials comparing glue traps to non-glue traps in addition to discussion relative to differences obtained in the difference types of glue traps (covered vs. uncovered, trays vs. boards, etc.).<p>

Glue traps are a popular tool for mouse control.  They are nontoxic, easy and quick to use, any results are readily visible to a client, and the traps can be sold directly to the clients, or back-up traps can be left with a client to help reduce the number of call-backs.  Glue traps also provide a two-in-one advantage of monitoring for insects while acting as a mousetrap (and vice versa).  The success of glue traps is seen in the surge of companies producing and selling large quantities of bulk glue and glue traps for rodent control.<p>

On the other hand, it could be questioned if these traps are too convenient and easy to use.  The goal to eliminating mouse infestations in commercial facilites, for example, is to attack the infestations as a colony level, and not simply harvest off individuals, on a regular basis with the use of any easy-to-use trap (of any type).<p>

Public attitudes concerning glue traps also need to be considered.  Some groups consider glue traps to be an inhumane approach toward rodent control.  Therefore, rodent glue traps are best used when casual public contact is not likely to occur.<p>

Frishman (1981), Frantz and Davis (1991), and Corrigan (2001) provided several tips and suggestions regarding the use of glue traps, including:<p>

1.  Glue traps must be checked frequently.  Over time, captured mice and rats can use their own feces, urine, and hair to escape from traps.  Frantz and Davis (1991) stated, "It is prudent to monitor glue traps at 24-hour intervals since their effectiveness may be reduced by surface contamination (dust, soil, feces, and urine) and temperature extremes.  Also, lab studies show that mice do not readily die within  24 hours of capture; hence services should be frequent in order to humanely disposee of captives as well as to ensure that rodents do not have enough time to work themselves free."  In the field, Corrigan (1997) foudn some mice endured up to 48 hours on glue traps before expiring.<p>

2.  To avoid having glue traps stpped on or interefered with, and to protect them from dust, glue traps can be installed inside bait stations or multiple-catch mousetraps, or protected in some similar manner.<p>

3.  Protected glue traps can also be desinged by bending a glue trap and inserting it into a cylinder made of cardboard of a short piece of 2- or 3-inch diameter PVC pipe.  These cylinders can then be taped to pipes hanging near ceilings, secured on narrow ledges, and other areas where rodents travel, or placed between pallets or toehr narrow spaces used by mice as runways.<p>

4.  Sume glue trap manufacturers claim efficacy for mouse control in areas as cold as 14°F (-10°C) and as warm as 100°F (38°C) or higher.  In general, however, glues are less effective in very cold or hot environments.<p>

5.  Glue traps should always be secured to the substrate using double stick tape or adhesive, to prevent captive rodents with free legs from moving the traps to less effective locations, to areas where children or pets might become involved, or to there the public might encounter them.<p>

6.  Dust and wetness can render flue traps ineffective.  Thus, glue traps are not appropriate in areas where rodents may carry dirt and moisture on their feet and body."<p>

<p><strong>Ultrasonic Devices.</strong>  "Ultrasonic machines generate sounds which are beyond those of human hearing (greater than 20 kHz).  Rats can hear within a  range of up to 100 kHz and mice up to 90 kHz.<p>

As of 2003, ultrasonic machines are still sold widely over-the-counter in hardware stores and neighborhood "mart" stores, as well as in garden and specialty tool catalogs of all types.  Some researchers (McCartnet and Jackson 1986, 1988) reported that wild rodents in field situations can be affected by ultrasonic machines, and their normal activities and travel routes can be altered.  Thus, it may be possible to channel rodents into desired areas, or possibly repel them from specific areas."<p>

<p>Handbook of Pest Control; Mallis, Ninth Edition. Pages 74-75</p>

<p><strong>Electromagnetic Devices.</strong>  "Electromagnetic devices are supposed to work on the principle that a magnetic field produces a barrier that has a stunning or repellent effect on rodents.  Sometimes, electromagnetic devices are confused with ultrasonic devices; however, the two are entirely difference.  As of 1996, however, at least one company still markets a machine which claims to incorporate both electromagnetic and ultrasonic effects.<p>

Pest Control magazine (Anonymous 1977) reported after interviewing some of the top experts in the country, that no scientific evidence is available to show these devices work.  In 1979, EPA had obtained federal court orders prohibiting the sale of several electromagnetic devices because they did not work (Anonymous 1979a).  Despite this, advertisements for such devices can still occasionally be seen.   Nothing has changed as of 2003 - such devices would have no more effect on rodents than a common household appliance (Frantz and Davis 1991).  Their use should be avoided."<p>

<p><strong>Controlling with Rodenticides.</strong>  "Rodenticides are pesticides that kill rodents, and modern rodenticides consist of two broad groups: anticoagulants and non-anticoagulants.<p>

The older rodenticides Antu, arsenic, barium carbonate, DDT, norbormide, phosphorous paste, red squil, sodium fluoroacetate (compound 1080), strychnine, and thallium sulfate, and the anticoagulants coumafuryl, pindone, and isovaleryl indandione (e.g., Pival) are either no longer registered, used rarely, or are no longer used in most commensal rodent programs because of the more efficarious and/or less hazardous modern rodenticides.  Thus, these compounds will not be discussed in the edition.  Also, the rodenticides used in other countries, but not registered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for commercial use in the U.S. are also not discussed.  Readers interested in the early rodenticides should consult earlier editions of the Handbook of Pest Control.  In-detail discussions on old and new rodenticides used around the world are provided by Meehan (1984), Prakash (1988) and Buckle and Smith (1994).<p>

<p><strong>Anticoagulants.</strong>  The anticoagulant rodenticides comprise about 90% or more of the baits used by pest management professionals.  Anticoagulant rodenticides cause death as a result of internal bleeding which occurs as the animal's blood loses its clotting ability and capillaries are destroyed.  The active ingredients are used a low levels of from 25 ppm to 50 ppm.  All anticoagulant rodenticides are relatively slow-acting; death ranges from three days to 10 days following the ingestion of a lethal amount of bait depending on the particular active ingredient.  Bait shyness does not occur with anticoagulant rodenticides.  Because of the addition of more advanced anticoagulants are now classified as first-generation and second-generation anticoagulants.<p>
