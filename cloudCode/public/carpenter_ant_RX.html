 Non-repellent insecticides are effective as perimeter treatments
when applied to the exterior foundation, around door and window
frames and under the lower edge of siding (Hansen 1989).   Trails
should also be treated when they can be located.  In locations prone
to infestation (e.g. wooded lots), a perimeter treatment may be
applied biannually, or at least in the spring, when the carpenter
ants become active.  These same insecticides can be used to treat
around tree trunks harboring carpenter ants, as well as any nests
that may be found inside a tree.  These materials are effective at
low concentrations and are readily transferred to other ants, thereby
reducing the total population.  Perimeter treatments with
nonrepellent insecticides are especially effective when satellite
nests are indoors and the parent nest is outdoors.  The interchange
of ants between the nests spreads the active ingredient to the entire
colony.  Such treatments, however, usually do not result in total
control of an infestation.  Location and treatment of the parent
colony should be the goal, with perimeter treatment assisting in
reducing ant activity inside the building.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#1f497d"><font face="Chalkboard, serif"><b>DUSTS.</b></font></font><font face="Chalkboard, serif">
 For nests found in structural voids or inside wood timbers, a dust
formulation can be applied in very light, thin layers.  Dusts become
repellent when applied too heavily.  Compressed-air or cordless
electric dusters are helpful in treating wall voids because of their
very light output and excellent coverage (Akre et al. 1995). Dusts
can be injected into wall voids either through existing openings
around plumbing and electrical lines or by drilling access holes.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font color="#1f497d"><font face="Chalkboard, serif"><b>BAITS.</b></font></font><font face="Chalkboard, serif">
 Carpenter ants forage on the ground and in trees and other
vegetation for insects and honeydew.  Therefore, baits should be
applied outside, along foraging trails.  A variety of baits should be
offered to the ants to determine their preference.  Baiting is most
effective during the foraging season and requires monitoring to
determine bait acceptance, amount consumed, and reduction in the ant
population (Hansen 2000).  Baiting is often slower in achieving
results than residual treatments but may be preferred by clients and
is important to reach those colonies that may be out of reach for
treatment, such as trees or on a neighboring property.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Chalkboard, serif">In
an initial treatment for carpenter ants, the professional may drill
and remove switch plates to apply dust into wall voids and also may
apply a perimeter treatment outside (Akre et al. 1995).  If baits are
used in combination with residual treatments, the baits should be
applied first, permitting ants several days to feed on them so the
active ingredient can be distributed through the colony.</font></p>
