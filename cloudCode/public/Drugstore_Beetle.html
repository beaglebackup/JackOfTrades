<h1>Drugstore Beetle</h1>
<h2>Stegobium paniceum (Linnaeus), Family Anobiidae</h2>
<p>The
drugstore beetle is a common pest of the home and storehouse and is
worldwide in distribution.  It was given the Latin name paniceum
because it feeds on bread, but its appetite includes practically
everything edible and many things nonedible to people.  In the
household, it feeds on flour, meal, breakfast foods, spices (e.g.,
red pepper and sundried tomatoes), pet foods, horn and antler, and
green coffee beans.  This insect has even infested toxic materials
such as wheat poisoned with strychnine.  
</p>

<p>It
is also a serious pest of books and manuscripts and has been known to
bore in a straight line through a whole shelf of books.  It has been
recorded feeding on a mummy and has been known to perforate tin foil,
lead sheeting, and wood.</p>

<p><strong>Description.</strong>
 This beetle is cylindrical in form, measures about 1/10 inch (2.5
mm) long, and is uniform brown in color.  The head is not visible
from above, and its legs and antennae remain pressed to the body when
the insect is at rest, thus enabling it to escape detection.  Adult
drugstore beetles resemble cigarette beetles but are easily
recognized by the presence of rows of deep pits on their wing covers.
 The wing covers on a cigarette beetle have not pits.  The drugstore
beetleâ€™s antennae are serrated (saw-like).</p>

<p><strong>Life History.</strong>  The
female deposits eggs singly in a suitable food media.  In powdery
substances, the larva forms a little round ball or cell that becomes
its pupal cocoon.  Four broods per year may result in a fairly warm
atmosphere.  Under cool conditions, only one generation per year is
produced.  Adults are not known to feed on food product, but can chew
through packaging materials.</p>
