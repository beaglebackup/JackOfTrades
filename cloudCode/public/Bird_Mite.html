<h1>Bird Mite</h1>
<h2>(Ornithonyssus sylviarum)</h2>

<p><strong>Background Information.</strong>  Mites
are closely related to spiders and typically feed on a specific host
animal. While bird mites are specifically associated with birds, they
will feed on humans in lieu of their primary hosts. 
</p>

<p><strong>Distribution &amp; Habitat.</strong> 
Bird mites are found in the nests of the host bird. If the bird is no
longer in the nest, they will seek out alternative hosts. This is
when they are commonly found inside the home. 
</p>

<p><strong>Identification.</strong>
 Bird mites are barely visible to the naked eye, 0.7 to 1 mm in
length. They are commonly compared in size to a period at the end of
type print. They are translucent until they’ve had a blood meal,
and then turn a reddish brown color. 
</p>

<p><strong>Life Cycle.</strong>	Bird mites
need to feed off their bird host animal prior to reproducing. Females
lay several eggs at a time. They go through 5 life phases; egg,
larva, protonymph, deutonymph and adult. Development takes an average
of 5-12 days. 
</p>

<p><strong>Feeding Behavior.</strong>  Bird
mites feed on the blood of birds. In the absence of their host
animal, they will feed on other warm blooded animals, including
humans. Mites have specialized mouthparts they are able to insert
into the host’s skin to remove blood. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Health Concerns.</strong>  The most
common human reaction to bird mite bites are itching at the location
of the bite.
