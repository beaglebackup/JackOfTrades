<h1>Confused Flour Beetle</h1>
<h2>Tribolium confusum (Jacquelin du Val)</h2>

<h1>Red Flour Beetle</h1>
<h2>Tribolium castaneum (Herbst)</h2>

<p>“The
adults of these two flour beetles are very similar in life history,
habits, and appearance.</p>

<p>Prior
to its presence in people’s homes, this beetle is believed to have
lived under bark and in old logs, and probably scavenged for food,
later becoming a flour-feeder.  The flour beetles are cosmopolitan,
and the red flour beetle is essentially an insect of warm climates,
whereas the confused flour beetle occurs commonly in the northern
part of the United States.  It is believed that the confused flour
beetle is of African origin and that the red flour beetle is an
Indo-Australian insect.</p>

<p><strong>Description.</strong>
 The adults are small, flattened, reddish brown beetles, about 3/16
inch (3.5 mm) in length.  The key identifying characteristic is seen
in the antennae of the two beetles.  The antenna of the red flour
beetle ends abruptly in a three-segmented club, whereas the antenna
of the confused flour beetle gradually enlarges into a club
consisting of four segments.  The eyes of the red and confused flour
beetles warp around the sides of the head from top to bottom.  On the
underside of the head, the eyes of the confused flour beetle are
widely spaced from each other, whereas the eyes of the red flour
beetle converge more closely.</p>

<p><strong>Life History.</strong>  These
flour beetles are omnivorous and are extremely important pests of
flour, being the most commonly encountered pests in flour mills. 
They feed on grain dust and milled cereals but are unable to attack
sound and undamaged grain.  Red flour beetles are attracted to flour
of high-moisture content.</p>

<p>When
the beetles are present in great numbers, they may cause the flour to
turn grayish and to mold more quickly.  Moreover, they impart a
disagreeable taste and odor to the flour from a secretion of their
scent glands.  These insects also infest cereal products and pet
foods and are commonly seen in grocery stores and food warehouses. 
Pest management professionals occasionally find flour beetles
infesting their supply of rodenticides.  These beetles are also
carried into homes in infested cereals, flour, and dried pet foods
and from there infest other foods in the cupboard.  Being active,
they quickly run to cover when disturbed.  Because of their small
size, these beetles are able to invade many packaging types.  Flour
beetles, however, have difficulty climbing over smooth vertical
surfaces such as polyethylene plastic or glass.  As a result, live
and dead beetles could accumulate at the base of items made of these
materials. 
</p>

<p>The
flour beetles are unable to feed on undamaged grain and occur in
grain first infested with internal feeders such as rice weevils or
lesser grain borers.  Later, as the grain develops cracks, they may
do considerable injury through their own efforts.  Other foods
attacked include peas, beans, shelled nuts, dried fruits, spices,
milk chocolate, and herbarium and museum specimens.  Adult beetles
can be predatory on the eggs of the rice moth.  Corcyra cephalonica
Staint.</p>

<p>The
adults of the red flour beetle can fly short distances, but the
adults of the confused flour beetle, although similarly provided with
wings, have not been observed in flight.  They are capable of
breeding throughout the year where the building is warmed during the
winter, but only the adults are found inside unheated buildings.  The
adult insects are long-lived and may live for more than three years,
but usually less.</p>

<p>The
eggs are whitish or colorless and are covered by a sticky material to
which particles of flour adhere, making them very difficult to
detect.  These are deposited in the food material in which the female
happens to be at the time of oviposition.  The life cycle varies with
environmental conditions.  The number of larval instars range from
five to 18, but seven or eight is more common.  The incubation period
for the egg is approximately nine days at room temperature.  The
larva, when mature, measures about ¼ inch (6 mm) in length, and is
white to yellow in color.  It is distinguished by the two-pointed or
forked termination of the last body segment. “</p>
