<h1>Cigarette Beetle</h1>
<h2>Lasioderma serricorne (Fabricius), Family Anobiidae</h2>

<p>This
cosmopolitan species infests tobacco wherever it is stored and is the
most destructive pest found in stored tobacco.  It is also a very
serious pest books where it may cause injury to the binding and the
leaves.  Furniture upholstered with flax tow or straw also supported
infestations of this beetle.  The adults are strong sliers and will
fly on late afternoons and dull cloudy days.</p>

<p>The
foods upon which it feeds are legion and include rice, ginger,
raisins, pepper, dried fish, dates, belladonna, drugs, seeds,
cottonseed meal, processed grain products, rodent baits, and
pyrethrum powder strong enough to kill cockroaches,  Dried flowers
may be a source of infestation in the house.  This beetle is the
chief offender in botanical circles where it is known as the
“Herbarium beetle.”  This beetle may also damage silk.</p>

<p><strong>Description. </strong> The cigarette
beetle is a small, squat beetle, measuring 1/8 inch (2 to 3 mm) in
length, and is shiny reddish-brown.  It resembles the drugstore
beetle but is lighter colored and does not have the lines of pits on
its wing covers.  Its antennae are serrated while those of the
drugstore beetle end in a three-segmented club.  
</p>

<p><strong>Life History.</strong>  The eggs
are laid in the folds of newly harvested baled or bundled tobacco in
storage, never in the tobacco leaves in the field.  The eggs may also
be laid at the open end of a cigar, etc., where they can be difficult
to detect.  The beetles become distributed widely throughout the
factory in the hogsheads or in cigars to oviposit.  
</p>

<p>The
eggs hatch six to 10 days after deposition.  The larvae shun the
light and make long cylindrical galleries through the leaves while
feeding on the edges and center of the leaves.  Although the larvae
feed on a great variety of vegetable matter, they generally prefer
cured tobacco leaves and manufactured tobacco.  At about 60*F(16*C),
the larvae become dormant and may then hibernate.  
</p>

<p>Five
to six overlapping generations per year may occur in warm localities,
but only one generation in more temperate regions.  In the United
States, three generations per year can occur.  The adults are strong
fliers and are active in subdued light at temperatures above
65*F(18*C).  The winter is usually passed in the larval stage, but
the adults, which are not very cold-tolerant, may secure themselves
in some crevice.</p>

<p>The
Fourth instar larvae are more tolerant of colder temperatures
surviving below 45*F (7*C) for several weeks.  More than six days is
required to kill adult beetles at 40*F (4*C).</p>
