<h1>MANAGEMENT OF CRICKET INFESTATIONS</h1>

<p>Knowledge of the behavior and habits of the pest cricket involved is important for controlling these insects. As a group, crickets are generally nocturnal and display a preference for cracks and crevices. Building lights and street lights or strongly lighted windows readily attract the field, house, and, occasionally, ground or mole crickets. but lights not attractive to the camel cricket. which prefers dark, damp areas.</p>


<p>The Jerusalem, mole, and ground crickets are not normally structural pests. The house and camel cricket can both live and breed in homes, offices, food establishments, or in  industrial buildings such as warehouses. The field cricket is a frequent invader of buildings, especially in late summer and early fall, and becomes more of an indoor pest problem in the mid-South and southwestern United States. Tree crickets are not found indoor and usually confine their activities to trees and woody ornamental plants outdoor important to note that with the exception of the mole cricket, crickets are not important agricultural pests, although seasonal exceptions do occur.</p>

<p><h6>Harborage Removal.</h6> Removal of piles of items, heavy ground cover (e.g., ivy similar harborages helps to minimize the numbers of crickets around buildings. Indoor clutter in storage areas also provides shelter. Proper storage of items and eliminate other harborages inside and out are important steps in cricket control.</p>

<p><h6>Exclusion.</h6> Doors with tight-fitting weatherstripping deny crickets their most common entry point. Other potential entry points such as foundation vents, clothes-dryer  basement window frames, plumbing, and electrical entrances, should be screened caulked. Weep holes can be screened by inserting pieces of screening or wire mesh.</p>

<p><h6>Elimination of Moisture Sources.</h6> Moisture control is especially important in controlling camel crickets and house crickets breeding in damp crawlspaces and base. A Vapor barrier and additional foundation vents may need to be installed in crawlspace dehumidifier may be used to make a damp basement or cellar less hospitable to insects.</p>

<p><h6>Outdoor Lighting.</h6> Exterior building lights and strongly lighted windows readily attract field, house, and, occasionally, ground crickets. Keeping lights off except when crickets are most active, but this is not always possible. When lighting is required, it is best to use yellow &quot;bug light&quot; bulbs or sodium vapor lamps which are less attractive to insects than white, neon, or mercury vapor lamps (pinto 2002a). In commercial situations,  moving the outdoor lighting away from the building will attract fewer crickets to the structure.</p>

<p><h6>Physical Removal.</h6> The use of monitoring traps near doorways can intercept some crickets as they enter. Such traps may also be used to capture one to a few crickets in a room. A vacuum may be used to remove crickets in sensitive situations where treatments are not preferable.</p>

<p><h6>Treatments.</h6> When treatment with insecticides is required, several types of formulations should be considered, making sure to fit the formulation to the treatment site. Maximum consideration should be given to selecting the insecticides that will provide the most effective, efficacious application. The label should be consulted for any specfic instruc足tions regarding crickets.</p>

<p><h6>House and Field Crickets.</h6> It is necessary to treat under baseboards, around doorways, beneath stairways, in basements, in crawlspaces, in garages, and other areas where these crickets are found in the home. When house crickets are involved, attics may require investigation. Since house crickets will live and breed in homes, closets, book cases, and areas near water heaters, washers, dryers, dishwashers, or the furnace, all of these areas should be inspected and treated as necessary. Granular insect baits may also be used where crickets are found in attics or crawlspaces. In garages and basements, baits may be placed inside stations.</p>

<p><h6>Camel Crickets.</h6> The walls in crawlspaces or basements where camel crickets are found resting may require treatment. Sill plate areas in crawlspaces may be treated with a dust product. Exposed vertical surfaces may be spot treated with a wettable powder (WP), suspen足sion concentrate (SC), or microencapsulated (MECS) formulation labeled for these areas.</p>


<p>Perimeter treatments, when combined with harborage reduction and exclusion efforts, can help minimize the numbers of crickets seen indoors. The base of the foundation, window wells, crawlspace vents, and around doorways may all require treatment. Weep holes in brick veneer walls may be treated with a dust prior to inserting screening or mesh. Perimeter treatments may need to extend several feet or more out from the struc足ture (or per state regulation). Treatments made to ivy beds and lawns need to be applied with enough volume to penetrate sufficiently to where crickets are living.</p>


<p><h6>Mole Crickets.</h6> Many birds as well as toads, skunks, armadillos, raccoons, and foxes have been observed to feed on mole crickets, thus causing damage to lawns and golf courses in their searches. A pest control company usually does not offer service to control this pest unless it also provides lawn care services which requires a separate license.</p>


<p>Mole cricket control with baits can be very effective if properly timed to take advan足tage of the mole cricket&#39;s feeding behavior. Under favorable conditions, mole crickets come to the surface to feed usually during late afternoon or early evening, preferably after a rain when the soil is moist and temperatures are warm.</p>


<p>Soil treatments with sprays or granules are generally more effective than baits as they don&#39;t rely on feeding, and timing is not as critical, although June is an optimum time for treatments in some climates. These materials work best when watered into the soil as it carries the insecticide to the root zone and encourages mole cricket activity in the upper root zone."</p>
