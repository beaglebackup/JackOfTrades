<h1>Flesh Flies</h1>
<h2>Family Sarcophagidae</h2>

<p>“Flesh
flies, or sarcophagid flies, are much larger than house flies,
usually about 1/3 inch (8 mm) long or slightly longer.  They are
grayish in color, with three distinct dark stripes on the thorax and
a gray and black checkerboard pattern on the abdomen.  Some species
are a nuisance around dog kennels where the larvae feed on meat
scraps or dog feces.</p>

<p>Hedges
(1944) pointed out that, as their name suggests, flesh flies will
breed in animal carcasses.  Like blow flies and bottle flies, these
flies are usually the first insects to arrive at a carcass after an
animal dies, and in this role they are important insects in nature. 
Forensic entomologists use the larvae of flesh flies and blow flies
collected at the site where a murder victim is found to help pinpoint
the time of death.</p>

<p>Once
the eggs have been laid on a suitable breeding material, the larvae
hatch out and burrow under the surface.  It is not uncommon to
encounter the body of a dead mouse, for example, whose body writhes
and wiggles as the maggots move about inside while feeding.  After
maturing in a few days, the larvae crawl out of the breeding material
to pupate.  They generally crawl only a short distance before
burrowing into the soil to pupate.  In one very interesting case,
Ehmann (1977) observed a nighttime fish kill in a large backyard pond
in the San Francisco Bay area.  Before the end of the following day
the dead goldfish floating on their sides in the pond were covered
with sarcophagid eggs.</p>

<p>Sarcophaga
albrichi Park. Occurs throughout the southern Canada and much of the
eastern and Midwestern United states and is a pest of the southern
United States.  Mallis (1973) found S. aldrichi to be a very annoying
pest in resort areas in Somerset Country, Pa., in late June.  Some
individuals referred to these flies as “red_eyed” flies because
of their prominent red eyes.  Although they did not bite, they sat on
the skin and hovered around in annoying numbers.  In these cases, the
flies usually disappear within several weeks without any treatment. 
If necessary, spraying or fogging nearby trees with an appropriately
labeled insecticide may be helpful.</p>

<p>The
larvae of S. aldrichi are important predators of the pupae of the
forest tent caterpillar, Malacosoma disstria Hubner, a common pest of
sugar maples.  When there is a heavy infestation of forest tent
caterpillars, the adult sarcophagid flies may appear in great
numbers.  This is a case of a beneficial insect becoming a pest due
to sheer numbers.”</p>
