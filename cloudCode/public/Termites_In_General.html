Termites
In General</h1>
<p>“Throughout
history, humans have obligingly built wooden structure and made them
accessible to termites.  The Romans have referred to these insects as
“Termes” which aptly means “woodwork.”  Termites are among
the the most ancient insects.  Their fossilized remains have been
found in formations more than 100 million years old, and they likely
evolved from primitive wood-eating cockroaches.  To this day, their
diet has consisted solely of wood and other cellulose-containing
materials.  So the impression of the unfortunate homeowner – that
termites have suddenly appeared like some ravenous horde from another
planet – is rather shortsighted.</p>
<p>Termites
are social insects, living in cooperative and cohesive colonies.  In
termite societies, the efforts of each member are directed toward the
success of the whole.  Individuals are relatively long-lived (worker
termites, for example, may live about two years), colonies are
self-perpetuating, and have a constantly available supply of food. 
Moreover, termites are protected from enemies and extremes of heat,
cold, storms, etc. by their cryptic (hidden) way of life.  The
resiliency and destructive potential of termites is also related to
their abundance.  While small termite colonies may number in the
thousands, large can contain millions of individuals (Grace et al.
1989; Su et al. 1993).  Grace (1992) likened the foraging impact of
this many termites to that of a large grazing animal, able to ingest
almost 1.1 lb (0.5 kg) of wood each day.

<p>Termites
do more than merely provide work for pest management professionals. 
In nature, termites are very beneficial since they recycle wood and
other cellulose-containing materials that other organisms cannot. 
Feeding be termites enhances the decomposition of organic matter and
the return of nutrients to the soil.   Their tunneling activities
help to aerate soils and promote plant growth.  As a by product of
their digestion, termites also produce enormous amounts of methane. 
Since methane is a “greenhouse” gas that accumulates in the upper
atmosphere, termite activity might even have wide-ranging effects on
global warming and climate.</p>
<p>Birds,
reptiles, amphibians, mammals, ants, and other arthropods consume
termites as an important part of their diet.   Among many cultures of
the world, humans also partake of termites, which provide an
efficient and ready source of protein and calories.  Throughout
Africa, termites are popular food item roasted, dried, ground into
powder, and added to food as a paste (Berenbaum 1995; Pearce 1997). 
According to Pearce, some African tribes even use termites as
oracles. Important decisions can be made by placing a piece of wood
into a termite mound and noting whether or not it is eaten.”</p>
<p>What
is a Termite?  When termite-infested wood is broken into, one’s
first impression is of small, nondescript white maggots with legs.  A
closer look will reveal creatures that are far more interesting. 
Like other insects, termites have six legs and a body divided in
three main regions: head, thorax, and abdomen.  Situated on the head
is a pair of straight antennae made up of tiny bead-like segments. 
Also on the head is a pair of mandibles used for eating, defense and
other functions.  Termites are sensitive to stimulation by touch,
odor, taste, and pressure.  They detect such stimuli with tactile
hairs and other specialized sense organs on various parts of their
bodies.</p>
<p>Individuals
within a termite colony may appear quite different and perform
specialized tasks.  These life forms, known as castes, include
workers, soldiers and reproductives.  The workers are usually the
most numerous individuals in the colony, and the caste feeds upon
wood.  Worker termites are pale, soft-bodied, and prone to
desiccation.  In order to conserve body moisture, they must dwell
underground or within wood, away from desiccating air currents and
rays of the sun.</p>
<p>A
key difference between termites and other social insects, such as
bees and ants, is that termites have no pupal stage.  Furthermore,
immature termites look like tiny versions of the adults as is true of
cockroaches and crickets.  Another unique feature of termites versus
other social insects is that the male (king) termite does not die
after mating and remains with the female (queen as a long-time colony
member.  Termites are classified in the insect Order ‘Isoptera’
(iso meaning equal; ptera meaning wings) – so-names because the
primary reproductive, commonly referred to as swarmers, have two
pairs of almost identical wings.”</p>
