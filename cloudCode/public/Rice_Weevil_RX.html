<p><strong>Control.</strong> "Rice weevils (and especially maize weevils) are good flyers.  Adults can enter structures some distance from infested fields or other sources of infestation.  However, invasions are usually from nearby sources.  For instance, rice weevils infested a pasta factory by flying from an adjoining building where grain was ground into flour.</p>

<p>control will usually start with locating the source, which usually is  in some form of whole grain products, but the source may not be obvious.  In homes, possible sources include "Indian corn" saved as a decoration, dried arrangements of wheat or other seed bearing plants, birdseed, or whole corn used to feed animals.  Even nuts and seeds in the food hoard of a rodent in a wall of a home may be a source.  Destruction of the infested material is the simplest method of control.  Small smounts of infested material can be frozen.</p>

<p>Small, limited, adult infestations of weevils in exposed locations can be controlled using space treatments of 3% pyrethrins or other contact insecticides.  The infested material should be located and receive attention, otherwise repeat treatments will be required.  Some residual insecticides, including products containing cyfluthrin, can be used as crack and crevice or spot treatments against rice weevils on nonfood surfaces or in empty steel and concrete bulk grain bins.  In bulk grain storage, fumigation is the standard control strategy."</p>
