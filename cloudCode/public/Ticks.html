<h1>Ticks</h1>

<p>“Ticks
are blood-sucking ectoparasites that cause significant skin lesions
such as papules, nodules, and extensive secondarily infected areas of
tissue.  In addition to bite reactions, they are capable of
transmitting a wide variety of disease organisms, such as protozoa
(babesiosis), viruses (encephalitis and Colorado tick fever), and
bacteria (Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis, Lyme Disease,
and tularemia) (Spach 1993; Goddard 2000).  They seem to be
especially associated with spotted fever group rickettsial organisms
(Burgdorfer 1977; Goddard 2001).  In addition, ticks may cause
paralysis in humans and animals as a result of salivary toxins
injected upon feeding.  
</p>

<p>Ticks
and mites belong to the class Arachnida, which also includes spiders,
scorpios, psuedoscopions, windscorpions, and other similar groups. 
Some species of arachnids are important parasites and vectors of
human and animal diseases.  Others are known for their bites or
stings, which can be painful or even fatal if not properly attended.</p>

<p>Of
the eight generally recognized groupings of terrestrial arachnids,
the Acarina (Acari), or mites and ticks, are considerably important
to people because they parasitize humans and domestic animals,
sometimes drawing sufficient blood in the process to weaken or kill
(for instance, the fowl ticks).  These arachnids may transmit disease
pathogens such as those causing Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme
disease, and tularemia (hard ticks), and relapsing fever (soft
ticks).  They may cause allergic reactions such as dust mite allergy.

<p>Ticks
and mites are not segmented, and the body is not divided by
constrictions (as in insects and spiders).  The larval stage has
three pair of legs, but the (one or more) nymphal stages and adults
have four pairs.  Mouthparts consist of a pair of chelicerae and two
short palps.  The body is divided into two regions: the first being
the gnathosoma (containing the mouthparts) and the rest of the body
making up the idiosoma.  Males are usually distinct in appearance
from females.“</p>

<p>	“Ticks
have a leathery body.  
</p>
<p>They
are usually 3mm or more in length.  
</p>
<p>Ticks
have a sensory organ on the top of the tarsi of legs.</p>
<p>Ticks
are ectoparasites on mammals, birds, and some on reptiles and
amphibians.</p>
<p>Hypostome
barbed – It is this structure which makes the removal of the tick
difficult.</p>
<p>Ticks
have 1-8 nymphal stages.”</p>
