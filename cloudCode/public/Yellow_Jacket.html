<h1>Yellow
Jacket </h1>
<h2>(Vespula
vulgaris)</h2>

<p><strong>Background Information.</strong> Yellow
jackets are a type of wasp, a family that also includes hornets. 
</p>

<p><strong>Distribution &amp; Habitat.</strong> Yellow
jackets build nest underground but will also build papery nests in
wall voids or hanging from trees or structures. Papery nests are
built from chewing wood fibers into a papery pulp. Nests begin small,
but can eventually house 3,000 to 15,000 individuals at a time.  
</p>

<p><strong>Identification.</strong> Yellow jacket
workers are 3/4 inch long, and queens are a bit larger, about 1 inch
long. As their name suggests, they are yellow with black markings.
They have a narrow “waist” between the thorax and abdomen. 
</p>

<p><strong>Life Cycle.</strong> Egg
bearing females, queens, lay single eggs into individual cells of the
nest, usually 10-20 at a time. In a year, a nest can contain up to
25,000-30,000 eggs. Once the eggs hatch out, the eggs hatch, the
queen will feed the larvae pre-chewed food. The larvae then use the
cells to create cocoons to become pupae. The larvae and pupa phase
takes approximately a month. Once they have become adults, the yellow
jackets become workers and take over all duties from the queen except
egg laying. Most of the nest will die off in colder months, b queens
will overwinter in stumps, bark, leaf litter or shelters and form a
new nest the following spring.</p>

<p><strong>Feeding Behavior.</strong> Depending
on the species, yellow jackets are scavengers or predators. Adults
typically feed on fruit and other sweet items like nectar, sap and
honeydew, but larvae are carnivores that will feed on other insects,
spiders or carrion. The workers feed the larvae and in return the
larvae secrete a sugary substance for the adults.</p>

<p><strong>Health Concerns.</strong> While
yellow jacket stings are painful, people only have strong reactions
if they are allergic to the venom or has been stung several times.
