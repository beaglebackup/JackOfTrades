<h1>Drain Fly</h1>
<h2>(Psychoda pacifica)</h2>

<p><strong>Background Information.</strong>  Also
known as moth flies because of their appearance, drain flies get
their name because of their habitat. 
</p>
 
<p><strong>Distribution &amp; Habitat.</strong> 
Psychoda pacifica are the species of drain fly that occur on the west
coast of the United States, from Southern California to Alaska. As
their name implies, drain flies are typically found near drains and
sewers. In residential facilities they are typically found in sinks
and bathtubs. In commercial facilities, they are found in and around
sinks, floor drains and other areas where moisture and organic matter
are allowed to accumulate.  Drain flies are able to survive in any
place where moistures is allowed to sit for a week or more. 
</p>

<p><strong>Identification.</strong>
 Drain flies are 1/12 inch long and are light tan in color and with
brownish-grey wings. The wings are densely covered with long hairs
that lend to the “moth fly” name. They have long antennae with 13
segments. 
</p>

<p><strong>Life Cycle.</strong> Adult flies
mate shortly after emerging from their pupal stage. Females lay
masses of 30-100 eggs which hatch out in 32-48 hours, depending on
temperature. The larval stage lasts 9 to 15 days, during which the
larva will feed on sediment, decaying vegetation and microscopic
flora and fauna. Larva and pupa are aquatic or semi aquatic. After
undergoing a brief pupal phase they emerge as adult flies. The length
of the life cycle is dependent on temperature, but typically lasts
anywhere from 8 to 24 days. Adult drain flies live about two weeks. 
</p>

<p><strong>Feeding Behavior.</strong> Drain
flies feed on decaying matter and microscopic flora and fauna. 
</p>

<p><strong>Health Concerns.</strong>  Despite
their association with sewers and other unsanitary locations, drain
flies are not known to spread any specific diseases.</p>
