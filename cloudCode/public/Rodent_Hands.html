<h1>Rodent Hands</h1>

<p><strong>sanitation.</strong>  "Good sanitation in conjunction with effective building construction and design of building provides better control than any other strategy (Scott 1991).  Based on the biology of rodents, it should be obvious that the overall health of a rodent, and the growth of rodent populations, heavily depends on the availability of food, harborage, water, and nesting materials.  When these resources are scarce or lacking, rodent populations cannot proliferate.

<p><strong>Exterior Areas.</strong>  Weeds and dense vegetation around the outside of structures are conducive to rodent infestations.  Vegetation provides rodents with food (plant material, weed seeds, insects, and other invertebrates), cover from predators, nesting materials, and a source of water.  Therefore, vegetation management is critical in minimizing rodent pressure from exterior areas.<p>

Commercial building foundations should be surrounded with an 10-to 24-inch (46 to 61 cm) strip of 1/8 inch (3 mm) pebbled rock (pea gravel) in a trench 4 inches (10 cm) deep, with a bottom of the trench lined with landscaping paper to prevent weed growth.  Rodents moving around such an exterior are more likely to seek shelter inside a rodent station, thereby achieving the desired result of exposing the rodent to the exterior rodent bait station or trap.  In residential neighborhoods, exterior baiting may not be possible because of the risk of children, pets, and wildlife being exposed to the rodenticides.<p>

In suburban areas, sanitation efforts are especially important.  Rats may remain undetected for weeks or months because they feed at night and often escape our attention.  Firewood should be stored off the ground and stacked away from the house.  Landscaping must be well maintained because shrubs and ornamental bushes can provide extensive ground cover, especially around foundations.  Thick vegetative cover can support rodent infestations dangerously close to doors, windows, and other parts of building entrances.  Regular mowing and possible herbicide treatments along fence lines may be appropriate environmental management needs.<p>

Limiting pet food to that actually eaten during the day and moving the bird feeder to an open area can be important rodent management decisions.  Compost piles should not contain food scraps (other than vegetables) which might provide rats with nourishment.  Fruit trees and gardens should be maintained by not allowing fruits and vegetables to rot on the ground.<p>

Around commercial establishments, loose garbage, rubbish, and other debris should not be allowed to accumulate.  Dumpster units may provide both rodent food and harborage, and they must be kept clean and in good repair and not allow for rodents to hide beneath or behind them.<p>

Additional in-depth information regarding sanitation for rodent pest management programs, especially as it relates to food processing facilities, is provided by Frantz and Davis (1991) and Corrigan (2001, 2003)."<p>

<p><strong>Interior Areas.</strong>  "For both mice and rats, sanitation within structures means cleanliness in all areas, including the out-of-sight, quiet, undisturbed areas.  Rodents naturally gravitate toward these locations to avoid possible predators.<p>

With rats, keeping a tight lid on garbage cans and picking up spills and debris goes a long way in reducing populations.  Mice prove different.  Someone's leftovers from lunch, the cookies used for coffee breaks, or even crayons can keep a mouse alive.  Food (sandwiches, snacks, candy) stored in desk drawers or old lunches left in employee lockers often support rodent (and insect) infestations in office complexes and manufacturing establishments.  Food scraps left by construction workers may result in rodents (especially mice) being "built-in" to new structures.<p>

For commercial facilities, "organization sanitation" is also important.  Moving items off the floor at least 6 to 8 inches (15 to 45 cm) and away from walls 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 cm) accomplishes two important goals: (1)  It allows an inspector to quickly detect new rodent activity, and (2) it increases the efficiency of baits and traps because the rodent is free to run along the walls and encounter the rodent control devices.<p>

Stock rotation in large warehouses is critical "First in, first out" prevents rodents from reproducing undisturbed for long time periods.  This factor is particularly important with mice as they can remain undetected inside cardboard boxes.  Damaged goods, especially when they are allowed to accumulated, provide both food and harborage."<p>
