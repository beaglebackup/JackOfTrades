<p><strong>CONTROL.</strong> "A thorough inspection is needed to determine all items infested by sawtoothed grain beetles.  Spilled food and grain can be a source for infestations under and behind shelving and storage racks.  In homes and food stores, infested packages are best discarded.  Heat or cold can be used to control this insect in small quantities of food.  Larger quantities of infested food products will require fumigation.  Residual insecticides can be used as crack and crevice or spot treatments against exposed stages in empty storage areas to prevent infestation of new food products."</p>
