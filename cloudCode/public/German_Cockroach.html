<h1>German Cockroach</h1>
<h2>(Blattella germanica)</h2>

<p><strong>Background Information.</strong>  There
are over 3,500 species of cockroach worldwide. Of the 45 species in
the Blattella genus, the German cockroach is the most common. They
have adapted to be only able to survive around humans or human
activity. 
</p>

<p><strong>Distribution &amp; Habitat.</strong>  The
German cockroach can be found worldwide and has become domesticated,
adapted living primarily in structures and controlled temperatures. 
They can be spread through commerce, transportation and infested
items, but also spread through migration, typically of gravid (egg
bearing) females. German cockroaches are commonly found in homes,
supermarkets, restaurants and other places with food sources. They
are primarily in kitchens, bathrooms, and other humid places where
they have daily access to water. They prefer to hide in wood and
paper material and because they are also attracted to warmth will
harbor in electrical appliances. Because of their flat shape, they
are able to hide in cracks as small as 1/16th inch wide.  The feces
of German cockroaches, or frass, have an aggregation pheromone in
them that attract other cockroaches to the area. 
</p>

<p><strong>Identification.</strong>
 German cockroaches average 0.5-0.6 inches long and brown in color
and have two dark stripes running from their head to wings. They have
wings but are unable to fly. Nymphs resemble adults but are smaller
and lack wings.  
</p>

<p><strong>Life Cycle.</strong> Male
cockroaches are attracted to the female’s sex pheromones. After
rubbing their antennae together, the female will consume nutrient
rich secretions from the male tergal glands. The pair then mates. A
female can mate more than once, but a she can fertilize all the eggs
she produces in her lifetime with just a single mating. 
</p>

<p>The
female produces an ootheca, an egg capsule less than a 1/4 inch long
that contains 30-40 individual eggs. Females typically produced 4-8
egg capsules in her lifetime. The female cockroach carries the
ootheca with her until the eggs are ready to hatch and then typically
deposits them away from cockroaches to prevent cannibalism. The eggs
have an average incubation period of 28 days, although that does vary
greatly. 
</p>

<p>Once
the eggs have hatched, the juvenile German cockroach goes through 6-7
instars before they become an adult. The time it takes to go through
this phase is dependent on temperature, and can range from 54-215
days, with an average of 103 days for development. Once they become
an adult, they typically live about 10 months.  Populations of German
cockroaches are usually 75% nymphs and 25% adults. 
</p>

<p><strong>Feeding Behavior.</strong>  The
German cockroach is an omnivore and a scavenger.  They are commonly
attracted to starch, sugary foods, grease and meat. They will become
cannibalistic at times as well. German cockroaches are nocturnal,
foraging at night and hiding in sheltered areas during the day. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Health Concerns.</strong>  Because
of their presence around food and garbage, German cockroaches can
pose health concerns from bacteria cross contamination. Pathogens
that have been found on German cockroaches include Enterobacter
aerogenes, Clostridium perfrigens (food poisoning), E. Coli, leprosy,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (respiratory infections; gastroenteritis),
Salmonella, Serratia macescens (food poisoning), dysentery, staph
infections, pneumonia, pinworms, whipworm, Amebiasis, and polio.
These diseases can be carried externally on the cockroach’s body,
bristles or sticky pads of the feet or internally within the gut and
excrements. 
</p>

<p>Cockroaches
can be a trigger for asthma. Children especially are at risk for
cockroach related asthma and those with high cockroach levels are
three times more likely to be hospitalized with asthma attacks.
People can also exhibit other allergic reactions to cockroaches
including skin rashes, watery eyes, congestion of nasal passages and
runny nose. 
</p>

<p>Cockroaches
can also be a stressor or a source of anxiety or shame. Because of
their association with unsanitary conditions many people can feel
shame for harboring cockroaches.
