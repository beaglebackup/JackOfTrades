<h1>Brownbanded
Cockroach</h1>
<h2>Supella longipalpa Serville) (=S. suppellectilium[Serville])</h2>

<p>“The
name “brownbanded” cockroach comes from the pronounced transverse
bands and coloration across the wings of the adults and bodies of the
nymphs.  This cockroach is similar to the German cockroach in
appearance, but may be distinguished by the following
characteristics:</p>

<p>There
is greater sexual dimorphism, with females having distinctly larger
abdomens  and shorter wings then males.</p>

<p>The
brownbanded cockroach lacks the two dark stripes on the prothorax
found on the German Cockroach.  Rather the pronotum has a black
bell-shaped pattern with a translucent border.</p>

<p>The
wings are twice-banded with brownish yellow stripes.</p>

<p>The
egg capsule is smaller than that of the German cockroach, being but
3/16 inches (5 mm) long, and having about half as many eggs.</p>

<p>The
brownbanded and German Cockroaches are similar in that they
completely depend on the human habitat for survival, and they are the
only known dedicated domestic cockroach species.  The origin of the
brownbanded cockroach is thought to be African. Rehn (1945).   “This
species hides in cupboards, pantries, or even in other rooms of the
house.  Preferences are shown for high locations such as shelves in
closets, behind pictures and picture moldings, and the like.  Egg
cases may be deposited about the kitchen sink, desks, tables, and
other furniture, and even in bedding.  This habit of hiding egg cases
in furniture probably accounts for its spread northward, for it has
been found that infested premises follow a trip to the South, or
transportation of goods from a southern state.” Gould &amp; Deay
(1940).   Benson and Huber (1988) reported that brownbanded
cockroaches have a preference for higher resting locations with 92.5%
of all oothecae deposited in clusters of two or more.  They also
report that in a laboratory experiment, females selectively placed
their egg cases in corrugated cardboard (74.5%), followed by sane
(24.5%), and finally Plexiglas (1.0%).</p>

<p>In
addition to being a pest in homes, the brownbanded cockroach is often
found in office settings.  This species does not have the same high
moisture requirement that the German cockroach has, so it can survive
in areas where access to free liquid may be minimal.</p>

<p>After
insemination, the female develops an enormously enlarged abdomen as
she becomes gravid.  When fully developed the protruding egg capsule
is yellowish or reddish-brown in color and is 3/16 inch (5 mm) in
length.  The female carries the mature egg capsule for 24 to 36 hours
and then attaches it to some object.  Females produce a greater
number of egg cases during the summer.  The brownbanded cockroach
prefers temperatures of above 80* as temperatures below 75* retard
its development (Gould and Deay 1940).</p>

<p>The
sex pheromone of the brownbanded cockroach, called supellapyrone, has
been identified and has markedly difference chemistry from the sex
pheromone of other cockroach species (Charlton et al. 1993).   Liang
et al. (1998) evaluated the synthetic version of supellapyrone for
use in detection and monitoring of brownbanded cockroaches and found
that trap catch was enhanced six to 28 times compared with traps
without pheromone.  The authors concluded that supellapyrone offers a
powerful monitoring and pest management tool for brownbanded
cockroaches.
