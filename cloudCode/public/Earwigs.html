<h1>Earwigs</h1>

<p>“Earwigs
owe their name to the widespread superstition that they purposely
crawl into  the ears of sleeping people and bore into the brain. 
According to Fulton (1924), the word “earwig” is derived from the
Anglo-Saxon “earwicga,” meaning “ear creature.”  Despite the
unusual folklore that surrounds this insect, translations of the
Latin names Dermaptera (order) and Forficulina (suborder) more
accurately describe the morphology of this insect.  Dermaptera refers
to the “skin-like” forewings present in winged species, and
Forficulina translates to “little scissors,” referring to the
prominent forcep-like creci extending from the abdomen.</p>

<p>The
cerci are used by the earwig as both defensive and offensive weapons,
and occasionally are used to capture prey.  Additionally, the
morphology of the cerci is quite variable and may be used as an aid
in distinguishing between species, as well as sexes.  The cerci of
females are typically much straighter when compared with the strongly
curved cerci of the male.</p>

<p>Earwigs
are brownish to black in color, narrow-bodied, elongate, and somewhat
flattened insects, ranging ¼ inch to 1 inch (7 to 25 mm) in length. 
Adults may be winged or wingless, and they have chewing mouthparts. 
The nymphs add antennal segments at each molt until reaching a total
of 10 segments as an adult.  The wings, when present, barely extend
onto the abdomen, with the tips of the folded membranous hind wings
extending from under the forewings.  Upon cursory glance, earwigs may
resemble rove beetles.  Approximately 2,000 worldwide species of
earwigs have been described, most occurring in tropical regions
(Arnett 2000).  Twenty species in 12 genera are found in the U.S.
(Arnett 2000).</p>

<p><strong>General Biology.</strong>  Over the
past several decades, relatively little research has been conducted
on life histories of the North American earwig species.  Earwigs
undergo gradual metamorphosis, and most species overwinter in the
adult form.  Some species have glands from which they squirt
foul-smelling, yellowish-brown liquid for defensive purposes. 
According to Eisner (1960), the European earwig, Forficula
auricularia Linnaeus, uses its cerci as a first line of defense and
the secretions as its secondary defensive tactic.</p>

<p>Earwigs
are active at night and hide during the day.  Being thigmatropic,
earwigs, like cockroaches, prefer to hide or rest in dark, moist
cracks such as those found under tree bark and beneath stones,
boards, and debris.  Kharboutli and Mack (1993) examined the effect
of hot and dry conditions in relation to desiccation of the striped
earwig, Labidura riparia (Pallas).  The researchers concluded that
this species has a relatively low tolerance for heat, which may
partially explain the earwig’s nocturnal activity.</p>

<p>The
diet of earwig is diverse and consist of a wide variety of plant and
animal matter.  Earwigs feed on leaves, flowers, fruits, and fungi,
as well as aphids and larger insects such as flies, captured with
their pincer-like cerci.</p>

<p>Earwigs
are well known for their gregarious behavior, which, similar to
cockroaches, is driven by an aggregation pheromone (Sauphanor 1992;
Walker et al. 1993).  At least in  the European earwig, the
aggregation behavior appears to be associated with contact between
conspecific individuals and frass,  resulting in aggregations of
several dozen to several hundred individuals (Walker et al. 1993). 
According to Sauphanor (1992), the aggregation pheromone is active in
controlling the aggregation behavior of all nymphal instars, as well
as the adults of both sexes.</p>

<p>Maternal
care is also exhibited among earwigs.  Females dig a burrow or
earthen cell into which they deposit approximately 20 to 60 eggs. 
Once this is complete, the females gather the eggs and organize them
into a pile.  The female tends to the eggs and guards the “nest”
from all intruders, including their mates.  Throughout the
development of the embryo, the female picks up each egg individually
in her mouth and “licks” them.  The function of this “licking”
behavior is still unknown.  It has been speculated that licking may
prevent the growth of fungus on the surface of the egg.  Shepard et
al. (1973) stated that eggs not regularly cared for by the female are
destroyed by fungal infections unless treated with a fungicide.  Upon
hatching, the young nymphs remain in the earthen chamber throughout
the first instar and are provided with food gathered by the female
(Vancassel 1977).”</p>
