<h1>American
Cockroach</h1>
<h2>(Periplaneta americana)</h2>

<p>

<p><strong>Background Information.</strong> Cockroaches have been on earth for over 300 million years. American cockroaches are also known as “Bombay canary”, “water bug” or “palmetto bug”. It is the second most abundant cockroach after the German cockroach. Despite their name, American cockroaches are not native to the United States, but were brought over on ships, possibly as early as 1625 from Africa.<p> 
<p><strong>Distribution &amp; Habitat.</strong> American cockroaches are found in sewers, ships, and basements. They are also commonly found in restaurants, grocery stores, and other food preparation and storage areas. They prefer moist areas, but will live in dry areas as long as there is a water source. They prefer warm temperatures, 84° F. They do not tolerate colder temperatures. 

<p><strong>Identification.</strong> American cockroaches grow over 2 inches in length and are reddish brown in color with fully developed wings. They have a pale brown or yellow band around their pronotum, or base of the thorax. Males are typically slightly larger than the females. Nymphs look like smaller versions of the adults, but are typically grayish brown early on and become reddish brown as they age.<p> 
<p><strong>Life cycle.</strong> Females lay egg cases about once a week(although under ideal conditions she can produce two), each with 14-16 eggs in them. These cases are deposited in warm, damp environments near a food source. Often females will either drop the ootheca or affix it to a surface with a secretion from their mouth for protection. They will also sometimes cover it to camouflage it in their environment. The eggs hatch out after 32-58 days. The young then go through up to 13 instars before becoming an adult, on average a month apart. From egg to adult average of 600 days. Once adults, they can live over a year, with life spans of up to 4 years reported. Females don’t need to mate multiple times to produce multiple ootheca, and produce an average of 150 offspring in their lifetime.<p> 
<p><strong>Feeding behavior.</strong> American cockroaches are scavengers. They eat a wide variety of items including starch, bakery items, plant matter, decaying material, dead animals, dead hair or skin, book bindings, paper, leather, and are especially attracted to alcohol. They will also cannibalize dead cockroaches or eat the frass of other<p> 
<p><strong>Health Concerns.</strong> Because of their association with sewers and other unsanitary conditions, American cockroaches can pick up pathogens like salmonella and over 22 other bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa and parasitic worms.  They carry these externally on their bodies and in their guts and contaminate food. Cockroaches and their frass (feces) are often triggers or asthma. Cockroaches produce odorous secretions that can alter the taste of contaminated food.<p>
