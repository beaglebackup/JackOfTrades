<h1>Starlings</h1>
<h2>(European)</h2>
<h2>Class
Aves, Order Passeriformes, Family Sturnidae</h2>

<p>“Starlings
are disliked in urbanized settings because of their raucous
vocalizations made at roosting time and because of filth (e.g., feces
and nesting materials) they leave behind.  Starlings also create
problems by nesting on or inside buildings.  Starlings have adapted
well to cities and suburbs where they utilize a multitude of roosting
sites, including building ledges, lighted signs, marquees, billboard
bracing, hollow lamp posts, soffits, as well as dryer and stove
exhaust ducts and vents.  Thousands of starlings may invade a city at
dusk and roost side by side, forming solids rows of birds.  Staring
also roost in trees, taking on a pest status when the trees are in a
city park or close to human habitation.  Not only is the roost
obnoxious to the senses, but the birds are known to transmit diseases
such as encephalitis, ornithosis, and histoplasmosis.  Starlings, in
addition to consuming large amounts of poultry, hog, and cattle feed,
are implicated in the spread of diseases of live-stock (e.g. hog
cholera) via fecal contamination.</p>

<p>Lawns
infested with the larvae of turfgrass pest insects are likely to be
visited by flocks of starlings which feed on insects and, in the
process, punch thousands of unsightly holes in the sod.  More costly
damage is inflicted by hungry starlings on cereal, fruit, and
vegetable crops in agricultural, orchard and garden settings.”</p>
