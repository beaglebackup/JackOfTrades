<h1>Southern Fire Ant</h1>
<h2>Solenopsis xyloni McCook</h2>
<h2>Subfamily Myrmicinae</h2>

<p>

<p><strong>Identifying characteristics.</strong>  "The workers are 1.6 to 5.8 mm long and polymorphic.  They have a two-segmented petiole, and a stinger.  Their antennae are 10-segmented with a two-segmented club.  The clypeus has two distinct teeth.  The body color is highly variable with the head and thorax yellowish-red and the gaster dark.  Some of the eastern forms have a brownish-black head and thorax.<p>
<p><strong>Distribution.</strong>  This ant is found in the southern U.S. from South Carolina to southern California, where it is known as the southern fire ant and cotton ant (Taber 2000).<p>
<p><strong>Biology and Habits.</strong>  Although this native fire ant can sting, it is less aggressive than its exotic sister species, the red imported fire ant.  In the latter case, any object touching the mound will be immediately attacked and stung.  The mounds of southern fire ants are irregular  craters consisting of scattered soil with multiple, obscure entrances.  In contrast mounds of the red imported fire ant are frequently built up into domes.  Southern fire ants nest in the open, under objects such as boards and stones, and sometimes in woodwork or masonry (Smith 1965).<p>  
Southern fire ants are omnivorous with a distinct preference for oily meats and nuts (Snelling and George 1979) and other high protein foods (Smith 1965).  According to Smith (1965), they will chew on clothing, kill young poultry, feed on various plants and seeds, gnaw into vegetables and fruits, and remove the rubber insulation from around telephone wires.  The workers also tend homopterans for honeydew.‚Äù<p>
