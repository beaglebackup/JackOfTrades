<h1>Argentine Ant</h1>
<h2>(Linepithema humile)</h2>

<p><strong>Background Information.</strong> The
Argentine Ant is a non-native invasive species of ant. It was
originally introduced to the United States in the 1800s through ships
transporting coffee from Brazil. Argentine ants thrive because nests
do not compete and more often work in cooperation. The genetic
profiles of the ants are so similar that an individual from one
colony can be introduced into another colony and will be readily
accepted by the new colony. This can result in interconnected
supercolonies. One such supercolony stretching 600 miles down the
coast of California. Because of their resourceful and resilient
behavior and lack of natural predators in the United States,
Argentine ants are often able to push out all other local ant
colonies.</p>
<p><strong>Distribution &amp; Habitat.</strong> 
Native to South America, Argentine Ants are now found on 6 continents. In
the United States, Argentine ants are found typically in the
Southeast as well as the west coast and Hawaii.</p>
<p>Argentine ants nest in both exposed and covered soil, and will adapt depending
on the time of year. These nests are typically shallow, only going 1
to 2 inches deep, although they can go as deep as 20 inches. Nests
can be found under stones, logs, debris, under cement slabs and
potted plants. Lushly landscaped areas can often create very
hospitable to colonies and make management very difficult. Argentine
ants thrive in urban environments, and because of their small size
are easily able to enter and infest homes. Bricks, piles of lumber,
wall voids, insulation, cracks and crevices, moist conditions like
bathtubs, under carpets, and even under debris like piles of boxes
can all harbor Argentine ants.</p>
<p>Argentine
ant colonies contain numerous queens, typically up to 10% of the
colonies are queens while the remaining 90% are workers. Unlike other
ant species, queens will help in caring for the larvae. Queens
can leave the colony with some workers and form satellite colonies.
Both workers and queens are not antagonistic to members of other
colonies, so these colonies can often connect into larger colonies or
repopulate another colony if its population has been depleted. 
</p>
<p><strong>Identification.</strong>
 Argentine ants are about 1/8th inch long and brown to black in color and shiny
in appearance. Queen Argentine ants are larger, 1/6 to 1/4th inches
long. They are often confused with the odorous house ant, but
Argentine ants have a pointed node between the thorax and abdomen,
while odorous house ant nodes are flat and not visible from the side
or top. 
</p>
<p><strong>Life Cycle.</strong> 
Colonies often have multiple queens producing eggs. Eggs production peaks in
the spring and summer months, although they can be laid throughout
the year. Exact peak time varies depending on location and
temperature. Eggs are very small, about 0.3mm long and white in
color. Eggs take an average of 28 days to hatch, although that is
temperature dependent. They then spend an average 31 days in a larval
stage where they undergo 4 instars before a 15 day pupal stage. Pupal
ants look like adults but their legs and antennae are held tightly
against the body. They are white at the beginning of the pupal stage
but become darker over time. From egg to adult takes about 74 days,
although can range from 33 to 141 days depending on environmental
factors such as temperature. Studies have found that the number of
males produced is dependent on the amount of food available to
larvae. The egg, larval and pupal stages all occur within the nest. 
</p>
<p>Worker
population is dependent on the time of year. There is a spike on
population from March to October and then a mass die-off in November.
During the winter Argentine ants will nest in the open. During the
summer the colonies will move out of direct sunlight into covered
areas. Males typically live for a few weeks, workers live for about
6-9 months and queens can live up to 7 years. 
</p>
<p><strong>Feeding Behavior</strong>. Argentine
ants typically forage when temperatures range between 50° to 86°F.
During the hottest parts of the day, Argentine ants will use
sheltered pathways or wait until temperatures have dropped to
continue foraging. Trails typically follow structural paths like
driveways, along building edges, baseboards, cracks between tiles and
along counter edges. Argentine ants lay down strong, easy to detect
trails. They deposit trails continuously to ensure they are always
covering new ground when searching for novel food sources. Once the
ants have found viable food sources they reinforce the trails to lead
others back to it. Once Argentine ants have found a viable food
source they will often set up a satellite colony near the food
source.</p>
<p>Argentine
ants are omnivores, and the type of food they consume depends on the
time of year. Argentine ants have a preference for “honeydew”
produced by aphids and will protect the species from predators in
order to have access to the honeydew. In indoor environments,
Argentine ants will infest any accessible food item. Once a food item
is located, other workers will be recruited to bring the source back
to the nest. Sucrose is a primary staple of Argentine ants diets and
99% of the food brought back to the nest is in liquid form.</p>
<p><strong>Health
Concerns.</strong>
 Argentine
ants are non-native invasive species that often out-compete native
species for local resource. As a result, local population drops and
the predators that feed on them can be effected. Specifically,
California horned lizards populations are being affected because
Argentine ants are impacting the lizard’s primary food source, the
harvester ants. Conversely, Argentine ants protect aphid populations,
which can negatively impact agricultural production. 
</p>
<p>There
are no known health threats of Argentine ants to the human population
and are considered a nuisance pest. Argentine ants can infest
food products, which is mostly a concern of economics more than
health. 
</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory
Concerns.</strong> Because
Argentine ants are not considered a public health threat, there is no
regulatory authority over their treatment. There is, however, concern
about the methods and pesticides used when controlling ant
populations. All buildings owned or operated by the City and County
of San Francisco can only be treated with allowed substances from the
San Francisco Reduced Risk Pesticide List.
