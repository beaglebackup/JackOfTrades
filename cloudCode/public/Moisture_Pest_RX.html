<p><strong>Nonchemical Methods.</strong>  Removing food sources as well as regulating humidity can dramatically reduce the incidence of these pests.  Recommended nonchemical control options include:<p>

1.  Reducing moisture and humidity is quite effective if the relative humidity of a structure can be reduced to below 45% to 50% and kept below that level, for example, most infestation of booklice can be brought under control.  If this moisture reduction is attempted by the use of dehumidification equipment, it is suggested that it be done by professional air-conditioning/heating specialists.  Mold-inhibiting interior paints may assist in reducing the potential for book lice to infest damp walls and other interior finish elements.  Attic and crawlspace ventilation can be improved, especially ones with "super-tight" insulating technology should be allowed to air out, or a dehumidifier installed, so any excess moisture within the wooden structure can be dissipated.  The four lined silverfish and firebrats, however, are not easily controlled by only eliminating or sharply reducing available moisture.<p>

Harborage sites should be eliminated by sealing cracks and crevices, especially around window sills, cabinets, and moldings.  Any cardboard boxes, newspapers, or books stored in high humidity conditions may need to be dried and stored differently or discarded (Pinto 2002b).   In the case of both silverfish/firebrats and booklice, an increase in lighting tends to make harborage areas less hospitable.<p>

2.  A vacuum device equipped with a "furniture tool" or "crevice tool" can be an  effective means of removing silverfish and firebrats if used in potential harborage areas on a regular basis.<p>

3.  The removal of leaf and grass litter from the area immediately surrounding a house or building also can remove much of the potential source of invasion of both silverfish/firebrats and booklice into a structure.  Exclusion via the sealing of cracks and holes around windows, doors, and the use of interior screens over vents is beneficial.<p>

4.  The author controlled psocids living on pallets of empty cans by advising the canning factory to store the pallets of cans in trailers in a parking lot under the hot Texas sun for a day prior to shipping them.<p>

5.  Potential food supplies should be identified and access to these materials should be eliminated.  Silverfish, firebrats, and booklice tend to seek out starchy materials; silverfish and firebrats, and booklice most often graze on the microscopic fungi that can grow upon these starch-laden or -coated commodities.  Food source materials that cannot be removed should be placed into tightly sealed containers.  Bathrooms should be vacuumed regularly, especially if cornstarch-based cosmetics are regularly used.<p>

6.  Sticky traps may reduce both silverfish/firebrat numbers when placed in or near infested areas, but will provide little reduction of booklice populations.<p>

<strong>Treatments.</strong>  Silverfish can be one of the more difficult pests to control, and total elimination of booklice from a structure is not likely.  The treatment for silverfish is not unlike that for brown banded cockroaches, involving treatment of cracks in all rooms of the home.  Particular attention should be paid to bathrooms, kitchens, and basements; however, any room in the house can have silverfish.  Often, the insects are living on the periphery and crawl into the living spaces one to a few at a time.  Finding and accessing the actual breeding sites can prove time-consuming and frustrating.<p>

Chimneys and skylights are known to have issues with water leaks, both minor and significant.  Rain gutters clogged with debris or improperly mounted can deposit water during rains onto fascia boards and soffits.  While repairing his own gutters, the author discovered the longstanding source of his home's silverfish-behind the fascia boards and in the soffits, especially around the chimney.  New gutters: fresh, dry wood; and improved attic ventilation have resulted in several relatively silverfish-free years.<p>

Silverfish can often be found during inspections using a flushing agent.  Treatment of dry cracks is best done using a residual dust, such as silica aerogel or diatomaceous earth.  Boric acid may also be effective.  Both products are inorganic, natural materials that act as a desiccant when placed in normally dry cracks and voids.  Both results in dehydration and eventual death of insects (Ebeling and Wagner 1959a; Mallis and Carr 1982).  The efficacy of both materials can be thwarted by applying these compounds in areas too damp or coated with excessive oils or fats.  Unfortunately, this fact often makes both of these control agents unsuitable for control of booklice.  Moist or wet cracks may be treated with a moisture-resistant dust (e.g., DeltaDust)(Pinto 2002b).<p>

Silverfish are difficult to control using baits, but some professionals have had limited success, in particular with the fine granular, Niban FG.  Such baits should be applied into or as close as possible to suspected silverfish harborages.  For example, granular bait may be applied into or as close as possible to suspected silverfish harborages.  For example, granular bait may be applied lightly into soffits from the attic space or through the soffit vents on the outside.  Baits may also be applied lightly between the boxes stored in the attic.<p>

In cases involving a wooden shake roof where numerous silverfish are found in the attic, spot treatments using a properly labeled microencapsulated (ME), wettable powder (WP), or suspension concentrate (SC) formulation applied to the roof decking in the attic may be helpful.  Avoid applying a residual dust product over the top of the insulation throughout the attic.  Instead, insulation should be lifted and the dust applied underneath around light fixtures.  A/C vents, and other penetrations through the attic floor into the rooms below.  The cracks around such items should be sealed in the ceiling to help exclude silverfish from easily entering rooms from the attic.<p>

Story (1985) indicated that for those items that can be removed to airtight containers or portable fumigation chambers, both napthalene and paradichlorobenzene (PDB) may be effective for the control of booklice.  Check the labels on these chemicals to insure federal and/or state registrations for this use, and the proper use instructions.<p>
