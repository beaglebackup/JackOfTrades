<h1>MANAGEMENT OF FILTH FLIES</h1>
<p>
The control of flies in and around urban structures affords a classic opportunity for ~  integrated pest management (IPM) program. Under most conditions in a typical urb,  environment, individuals should not be expected to tolerate flies indoors. Considering tl  habits of filth flies and the potential for disease transmission, the mere presence of flith flies indoors is generally repugnant.</p>

<p>
Because cafes, fast food purveyors, and restaurants (all of which handle human food are typical urban structures, it is pertinent to outline an integrated pest management (IPM) program for such structures. The components of a good fly management program can be modified to fit any structure, be it food processing plant, warehouse, shop, office building, or home. Goldstein (1992) called to our attention that &quot;abundant supplies of food and water often cause fly populations to explode in restaurants, particularly in late summers when warm weather compounds the problem.&quot; A six-step IPM program should include (1) sanitation; (2) cultural measures; (3) exclusion; (4) mechanical control; (5) legal issues; and (6) insecticide treatment.</p>


<p><strong>SANITATION.</strong> Sanitation is the key in eliminating fly infestations; pure and simple  Sanitation removes the food supply (breeding source) for the larval stage and eliminate odors that attract the adult flies. Residential structures such as homes and apartments are generally easy areas in which to control flies since the professional can  work directly with the residents on sanitation issues. The challenge is the food industry especially due to required recycling laws. Recycling areas are often overlooked and seldom cleaned to the extent necessary to stop flies from finding and breeding in these areas. Also, when sanitation is reduced due to economic pressures, the professional is put under additional pressure to eliminate fly problems. Sanitation efforts should be increased during warm weather when fly activity is generally highest.</p>

<p><strong>EXCLUSION.</strong> Despite the best sanitation efforts, flies are highly attracted to buildings cause of preferred temperatures radiating from the buildings. All of the doors leading the outside should be equipped with self-closing devices, including supplementary screen doors. Screens on doors should not have tears or holes, and the weather stripping around all edges of doors should be intact and tightly sealed. All windows also should be tightly sealed and have tight-fitting screens if the windows are opened. Cracks and other openings to the exterior that could admit flies should be sealed. Any nonfunctional self-closing devices or broken screens or windows must be repaired. Smoke-free buildings where workers frequently prop doors to smoke can allow large numbers of flies to enter. Doors propped open during night shifts, even for a few minutes, will attract night-flying insects inside.</p>

<p>Large overhead doors in warehouses, processing facilities, and other commercial buildings are often left open for ventilation during warm weather or because move­ment of items through these doors is nearly continuous. To prevent flies and other insects from entering these doors, either a permanent frame with screening or an electrically operated screen door should be installed. Cooperation to gain total exclusion is a must if the pro­fessional is going to win the battle in fly control.</p>

<p><strong>MECHANICAL CONTROL.</strong> Mechanical control efforts involve the use of devices to trap or exclude flies. Some of these devices include:
<h6>Air Doors. </h6> Many food serving facilities install air doors or window screens to keep out flies. Hedges (1994) recommended that air doors not be installed on exterior doorways as the outside weather changes often and can adversely affect the devices&#39; effectiveness. He recommended air doors be used between two interior rooms. Improper instal­lation may actually suck flies and other insects into the building. The manufacturer's instructions and recommendations should be followed closely. In addition to air doors, fans directed at areas where flies are loafing, landing, or feeding will immediately pro­vide a fly free environment as flies are dispersed by wind currents. The author reports excellent results of fly control near salad bars with small oscillating fans. Food can be covered or wrapped in cellophane should dust be an issue of concern.</p>


<p><h6>Insect Light Traps.</h6> Most flies are active during the daytime (diurnal). House flies, blow flies, and many other structure-infesting flies respond well to certain wavelengths of light, and, once inside a building, will be attracted to sunlight and fly to windows. Insect light traps (ILTs) are highly effective in attracting and capturing flies and other flying insects after they enter a building. Installed properly, ILTs work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in alleviating flying insect concerns. The types of in­sects captured by a trap can also alert one to a new infestation of pests or provide clues as to where an infestation is originating. Rambo (1995), in reference to light traps, asked, &quot;Are these control devices or monitoring devices? In talking about IPM programs, I would definitely call them monitoring devices.&quot;</p>

<p>
Insect Light traps have been used successfully in fly control programs for many years. The first light trap was an electric bulb hanging over a washtub filled with water. The first model of today&#39;s electrocuting light trap was developed in the early 1900s. Blacklight (ul­traviolet) lamps were first used in light traps in 1938. Most current ILTs utilize blue ultraviolet (UV) lamps; however, Veal et al. (1955) conducted a series of tests to compare the efficiency of an electrocuting trap with combined green UV Lamp against one containing blue UV light and found that, overall, ie green Light captured 30% more flies.</p>

<p>
Most failures in the use of ILTs for fly control in buildings are due to using too few traps and the improper placement of the traps. Gilbert (1984) showed that most flying insects cannot see or respond to a light trap more than 100 feet (30 m) away. Flies only respond within 20 to 25 feet (6 to 7 m). He also stated from practical experience that placing ILTs about 50 feet (15 m) apart throughout a facility worked well for attracting and trapping flies and other flying insects.</p>

<p>
Each situation is different and the structure should be carefully studied to determine how flies enter and move through the building. Light traps should be placed in areas &#39;here flies will have maximum exposure to the trap. These traps should first be placed within 12 to 25 feet (3.6 to 7.6 rm) of entryways to trap flies as they enter. ILTs should not e placed so they can be seen from outside, otherwise flies might be attracted in from the exterior. Traps should also not be located too close to a doorway or flies will fly past the trap before they can notice the light.</p>

<p>
A fly&#39;s nature is to fly in the space within 5 feet (l.5 m) above the floor, spending most of its time skimming surfaces in search of foo Pickens et al. (1969, 1975) showed more flies a caught when insect light traps are placed within feet (1.5 m) of the floor than if they are located 8 feet (2.4 m) above the floor. Light traps may be install, at ceiling level in areas to catch nighttime insects, for example, in front of large overhead doors in war houses; however, ILTs installed at low levels should be present elsewhere in the building catch flies.</p>

<p>
Many pest management professionals believe ILTs are ineffective because flies can be seen flying in the area of the trap and ignoring it. Beck (1968) demonstrated that flies go through intermittent periods of attraction to and disinterest in light. Casual observance of a fly in a room will show that the fly will go to a window for a short time and then fly to other areas of the room only return to the window after a period of time. Pickens et al. (1969) tested the effectiveness of ILTs in a 25-foot (7.6 m) square room. Out of 100 flies, 12 to 13 were captured the first minute, 60 flies were captured in the next two to three hours, and virtually all flies we captured in seven hours. These studies show that because of a fly&#39;s intermittent attraction to light, ILTs should be evenly spaced and the traps should be operated 24 hours a day.</p>

<p>The first successful light traps developed were the electrocuting traps (ELTs).
These traps use black light to attract flies to the trap where they contact an
electric grid, receive a usually lethal electric shock, and then fall into a tray at the
bottom of the trap. This tray needs to be emptied periodically of dead flies or it may become infested with other insects, such as Trogoderma and other dermestid beetles. The outdoor high voltage ELTs kill insects when they contact the grid of an electrocuting light. A popping sound is often created, prompting the nickname of &quot;bi, zappers.&quot; ELTs used by the pest control industry use a low voltage electronic field between the grids and are extremely effective in killing all types of flying insects. The outdoor &quot;zappers&quot; that use high voltage to kill insects may cause them to literally explode. The low voltage units available to the pest control industry do not cause this introduction of fly fragments into the air. The author reports that microscopic examination of thousands of midges, gnats, and small flies caught in catch pans of commercial ELTs showed scales, aristae (feather-like structures on antennae) and other small body par still intact. The Food and Drug Administration recommends both ELTs and Glue Light Traps (GLTs) be placed at least 5 feet from food and food production surfaces. In recent years, GLTs - traps using UV light to attract and capture flies on a glue trap - have become widely used and accepted by consumers. The low cost of these traps combined their silent operation, makes them particularly attractive. Most new ILTs now introduced to the market are glueboard-style traps.</p>

<p>
Numerous types and sizes of ILTs are available for use. Traps vary in size and the method in which they capture insects. Hedges (l995) stated that &quot;numbers and flow terms of flying insects, trap placement, and cost are three of the most important factors to  consider in selecting which light trap to use in a given situation.&quot; As of this writing (2004), a number of manufacturers have produced many types of ILTs and it would be difficult to list them all. The more commonly known light traps in the United States pest control industry include the Vector.&#39;?&#39; Vector™ Gold, and Vector™ Junior (Whitmire Mi­croGen); the Mantis® (pestWest, Inc.); the Sticky Tiger,® Sticky Bear,&quot; and the Flying Venus·&quot;(Gilbert Industries); the Catchmaster&quot; (Atlantic Paste &amp; Glue Co., Inc.); and &#39;aclipseTM (Automated Insect Control Division). Other ILT manufacturers include Gardner Manufacturing Co., Actron, Inc., and Insect-O-Cutor, Inc.</p>

<p>
Tom Moreland, research manager with the University of Maryland, Clarksville, Md., has devised a white plastic chute that may improve milk production or weight increase by minimizing the nuisance caused by flies to cattle. The chute is placed in the gateway ween the cattle barn and the pasture. As the cows pass through it, flaps that resemble
hanging sheets in an automatic car wash brush the flies off the cattle&#39;s faces and backs. A light in the grid cut in the side of this chute lures the flies into an electrocution at where they are killed. &quot;It is one after another &#39;POP-POP-POP-POP&#39; as they are passing through it,&quot; Moreland said. Tests at the university dairy farm in Clarksville showed that the device cut populations of horn flies and face flies by 77% and 71% respectively. It is well documented (Don Gilbert and David Gilbert) that the large ILTs are more effective than the smaller ones. The larger lamps will hold more phosphorous and will outperform and outlast small bulbs. ILT bulbs need to be replaced at least once a year, and the best time is just before the fly breeding season.</p>

<p><strong>LEGAL ISSUES.</strong> Every state, county, city, or town has a section of its laws containing a health code. Each of these codes contains a section that prohibits &quot;vermin&quot; (e.g., flies) from existing in restaurants and other food establishments. Ample legal structure is in place to support enforcement of codes prohibiting the presence of flies in a restaurant. Any pest management professional performing a fly control program for a restaurant would do well to become acquainted with the local sanitarian making restaurant inspec­tions. Professionals can be proactive by becoming active with their state and local health officer's associations and forming working relationships to provide a safe environment the public in regards to fly control issues.</p>

<p><strong>INSECTICIDE TREATMENT.</strong> Houseflies are very domiciliary for they tend to stay within restricted locale and then enter buildings. They leave the home only by accident or by being forced out through the competition of their own numbers. For this reason, house fly control may be effective on as small a scale as a single residence or business.</p>

<p>
Flies are inactive at night and will rest for several hours on one spot and thus are susceptible to residual insecticides because of the prolonged contact time. Scudder (1947) .ed, &quot;Studies of resting flies in various areas at night have revealed an interesting variety of preferences. At night during warm summer weather, house flies, as well as blow flies, rest outdoors. sharing similar resting places near their major daytime centers activity about garbage, manure, privies, stables, and kitchen entries. In cooler weather the house flies lend to rest inside buildings on ceilings and other overhead structure while the blow flies continue to choose outside resting places.&quot; Eric Snell of B&amp;G Equipment Co. reported that trapping alone will just keep populations of flies in check. Killing adult flies must be a part of any fly control strategy.</p>

<p>
Treatment with insecticides should be performed only after serious and irnaginative consideration is given to the previous five steps in the integrated fly control program Hedges (1993) noted that the control off lying insects and filth flies is more non-chemical in practice and that insecticide applications are used as a ancillary step to control adult flies. In most cases, insecticide applications will be limited to specific sites where adult flies land to rest. The insecticides suitable for use are available in four different formulations: (1) water-based residual insecticides, (2) time-release aerosols, (3) baits, and (&quot; ultra-low-volume (ULV) insecticides. Insect growth regulators show promise for fly control but label restrictions prevent their use in food areas.</p>

<p>
<h6>Water-Based Residual Insecticides. </h6> Wettable powder, microencapsulated, and soluble concentrate insecticides are ideally suited for control of adult flies on exposed surfaces. Such treatments are largely applied to fly resting sites, including: 
(1) on walls around entrance doors. especially those on the sunny side of the structure where flies, attracted by odors emanating from a building, congregate, waiting their turn to gain entrance; (2) around the window frames of windows; (3) on all surfaces of the Dumpster or other trash receptacle; (4) inside separate trash storage rooms; (5) and along window sills in a narrow strip of a microencapsulated insecticide applied with a paint brush.</p>

<p>
Resistance to many insecticides used for surface treatments is found in house flies where the populations are inordinately large and repeated applications are made over extended periods. Sites where resistance has most noticeably become an issue are live stock and poultry facilities and commercial buildings located near such facilities. The recent reduction in the availability of organophosphates and carbamate insecticides leave only various pyrethroids available for use in livestock barns, although newer classes of insecticides recently have been registered for fly control. Resistance management involving house flies, therefore, will depend even more on breeding site reduction and management. The use of bacteria to more rapidly reduce manure accumulations on farms being evaluated, and evidence exists that these bacteria may even result in the death of fly maggots living within manure piles.</p>

<p>
<h6>Time-Release Aerosols. </h6> Time-release aerosol insecticides are commonly used for fly control but are typically ineffective because they are installed in large rooms with excellent air movement. Machines to dispense aerosols are most effective when installer in enclosed trash rooms or enclosed entry vestibules in buildings. The public&#39;s exposure to pesticides should be considered carefully when using various time-release products. Many people may object to being exposed to the insecticide dispensed every 15 minutes in a facility.</p>

<p><h6>Baits.</h6> Fly baits were used for the control of house flies even prior to World War II. Several fly baits are currently available that can be effectively used outside around trash as of commercial buildings. Baits are effectively used in livestock operations and also have been used for important outside events, such as weddings or concerts. A disadvan­tage of baits is the need to reapply following cleaning activities or rainfall. Use of the bait inside fly stations of some kind can increase the length of time the bait will last.</p>


<p><h6>ULV Insecticides.</h6> ULV insecticides are nonresidual insecticides, usually pyrethrins combined with a synergist that are used in a space treatment or directed contact treatment. These treatments are applied using special­ized ULV equipment or special aerosol dispensers. Be­cause short-lived insecticides are used in space treat­ments, only flies that are present at the time of treatment will be killed. &quot;Space&quot; treatments involve the treatment of the volume of air space in a room and are used in fly control to contact and kill adult flies after fly breeding sites have been found and removed or after fly entry points have been sealed. &quot;Directed contact&quot; treatments are applied to small areas where flies are located within a room.</p>

<p><strong>MISCELLANEOUS METHODS OF FLY CONTROL.</strong> Harmon (1995) indicated that fly control requires a thorough inspection and understanding of fly identification and biology. The use of traditional pesticides is rapidly being removed from the equation - thus we must focus on alternative techniques.&quot; By 1989, many research personnel re­ported strains of the house fly that showed established or rapidly developing resistance to many of the insecticides that are still recommended for fly control. Many physiological mechanisms have been shown to be involved, and all of these must be considered in the development and use of insecticides.</p>


<p><h6>Taps.</h6> Fly traps and baits are still useful fly control tools. In some areas of the world, fish ads are placed in pails of water and set around the perimeter of villages. Flies are attracted to these pails and fall into the water and drown in large numbers. Generally, however, blow flies and flesh flies are attracted to these. House flies are not usually attracted and so continue to invade the village.</p>

<p>
Tube or snip traps coated with sticky glue are commercially available. Silhouettes of flies in various feeding and mating positions may be imprinted on the tubes of some brands. Flies are attracted to the silhouettes and become stuck to the glue. One caution to be
noted: Cases are known where songbirds were attracted to the Lure Stick by the fly silhouettes and became stuck to the trap where they died (Story 1988). Care must be taken in placing these traps when such accidents could likely occur.</p>

<p>
Atlantic Paste &amp;Glue sells a roll-type stick fly trap that may be used in exterior situations (e.g., a covered loading dock) and in livestock facilities. Called the Spider Web, this trap is hung horizontally about 8 feet above the floor and captures flies as they land to rest on the surface of the trap. Silhouettes of flies in resting positions serve to attract other flies, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the trap.</p>

<p>
Bishopp (1937) and Bishopp and Henderson (1946) recommended the use of a fly trap in addition to the usual fly control measures for the reduction of flies in an area. According to Bishopp and Henderson, the inverted cone trap is an effective fly trap. Flies are attracted to a nontoxic food bait located at the trap&#39;s bottom or within the trap itself. The insects enter through the cone at the trap&#39;s bot­tom and, entering the trap, are unable to discover how to leave. The Advantage™ Fly Trap is one commercially avail­able trap utilizing this strategy.</p>

<p>
A fly trap called the Pyramid™ Fly Trap recently en­tered the market. This trap is a plastic pyramid into which an attractant, such as sugar water or cola is placed. Flies attracted to the device crawl inside and become trapped. Bees and wasps also can be trapped.</p>

<p>
Glofcheskie and Surgeoner (1990) studied Muscovy ducks as an adjunct for the con­trol of houseflies. They found that the ducks ingested a mean of 25 houseflies in 15 minutes - faster than commercial bait cards, coiled fly paper rolls, fly sheets, or fly traps. Schrnidtmann (1991) demonstrated suppression of Immature house and stable flies in outdoor calf pens with sand, gravel, and sawdust bedding. Long et al. (199l) evaluated the insecticidal activity of various strains of Bacillus against larvae of houseflies.</p>

<p><h6>Parasites, Insect Growth Regulators, and Ear Tags.</h6> The use of biological control procedures look promising but as yet do not provide high levels of control over long periods of time. Some researchers suggest that the periodic release of pathogens, includ­ing nematodes, may have great potential in controlling flies. Wright et al. (1976) have worked with biological control agents that provided excellent control. Research by Rutz and Axel (1981), when they tested seven house fly pupal parasites as biological control agents in caged layer poultry facilities in North Carolina, suggested that several species of flies can be controlled by manipulation of known fly parasites. Combined releases of Muscidifurax raptor and Spalangia cameroni may prove to be highly effective in sup­pressing fly populations under the habitat and climatic conditions of that state.</p>

<p>
Olten and Legner (1975) released three parasitoids from December 1969 to April 1970 in an enclosed poultry house near Riverside, Calif. They obtained up to 46% para­sitization of Musca domestica, but only 16% of Fannia spp. Knapp and Herald (1981) studied the reduction of face flies, Musca autumnalis, on beef cows and calves in a herd with one 8% fenvalerate ear tag per ear during early summer. This resulted in an average of 90% reduction of the face flies during a 2l-week period. In another test of seven weeks duration, part of the herd was treated and the remainder were left untreated. The flies on the treated animals were reduced by 86%. Williams and Westby (1980) made an evaluation of pyrethroid compounds impregnated in ear tags for control of the face fly, Muscautumnalis, and the horn fly, Haematobia irritans (L.), on pastured cattle. Ear tags tested included 5% and 10% ear tags, and 1.5% decarnethrin ear tags. All three tags provided at least a 5% reduction of horn flies but less than 50% reduction of face flies during the 13-week study.</span></p>

<p>
Breeden et al. (1975) added methoprene to formulations of chicken feed to control house flies breeding in chicken manure. A rate of 50 ppm of methoprene provided excel­lent control of house flies after the mixture was fed for three days. Feed containing 5 ppm provided good control after being fed for eight days. Wright (1975) indicated the insect growth regulator diflubenzuron (l-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(2,6-difluorobenzoyl) urea) for­mulated in salt blocks greatly reduced the number of house flies developing in the feces of cattle consuming the salt blocks. A granular formulation has been successfully used or control of fly larvae in fresh manure and other breeding sites in livestock facilities.</p>

<p><strong>CONTROL OF BLOW FLIES. BOTTLE FLIES. AND FLESH FLIES.</strong> In most situations, blow flies, bottle flies, and flesh flies seen inside buildings are entering from outdoors and steps outlined in the house fly control section should be employed to control these invasions. A sudden appearance of a large number of these flies or their larvae inside a building is an indication of a breeding site within the structure, usually a dead animal of some kind or possibly the inside of a trash container. Hedges (1996) was aware of at least two cases where huge invasions of blow flies were traced back to a human body in a chimney. Evidently, potential thieves were not as skinny as they may have thought. Hedges (1994) found a mouse carcass in which blow fly larvae were feeding and placed it in a container. Upon pupation and subsequent emer­gence, 123 adult blowflies had developed in that single mouse</p>

<p>
Finding and removing the breeding medium is para­mount to success in controlling the flies. Removal of the animal breeding source, however, will not necessarily re­sult in the flies being eliminated. Blow fly larvae crawl out of the breeding site to pupate and may be located a number of feet away in voids, under carpets, etc. It is not uncommon during an inspection to find a number of fly pupae in the corners of a room. After the breeding source is removed, new adult flies may emerge from these pupae. It is important to attempt to find these pupae md remove them by vacuuming. Voids where the dead animals were located may be treated with a residual dust insecticide to kill adult flies.</p>
