<h1>CONTROL OF SMALL FLIES IN STRUCTURES</h1>

<p>
"The key to solving infestations of small flies such as fruit flies or phorid flies, is to find a  of the breeding sources and correct or eliminate them. Insecticide treatments are rarel  needed for these flies except for space treatments to kill remaining adult flies after breeding sources have been removed. Infestations of these flies persist because one or more breeding sources have been overlooked. Because these flies can develop in large numbers from a very small amount of decaying organic matter, this task can be very difficult.  Although a bakery was thoroughly washed each night, flour and moisture collected in cracks under the edge of kitchen equipment at the floor level. Phorid flies were breeding in these cracks by the hundreds. Only by scraping out the fermenting flour, scrubbing the cracks with soap and water, and drying the area with an air compressor was the problem solved (Hedges 1994). The cracks were sealed with a durable caulk to prevent flour from collecting in these areas again.
