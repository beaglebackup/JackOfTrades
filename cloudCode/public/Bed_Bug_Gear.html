<p><strong>Hepa Filtered Vacuum</strong> Function:  To physically remove bed bug adults, bed bug nymphs, eggs, molts  To remove debris from surfaces to improve efficacy of chemical products.<p>

<p><strong>PHYSICAL BARRIERS.</strong>  Climb Up Interceptors – Climbup Insect Interceptors are a unique and easy-to-use monitoring system to aid in the early detection of bed bug infestations. These specially designed plastic cups are pesticide-free and are coated with a thin layer of talc which makes them too slick for the bugs to crawl out. Bugs approaching the bed (or other furniture) from the floor will fall into the outer well while bed bugs leaving the bed will be captured in the center well.<p> 

Plastic Wall Barriers – Barriers such as plastic sheeting can be hung from walls, draped over bed frames, and even laid out on floor and curled up.<p>

Heaters &amp; Fans – Propane Heaters can be used in single family homes in San Francisco.  Multi-Unit buildings require the use of electric heaters.  Outside of SF propane can also be used in Multi-Unit Buildings.<p>

<h4>Aerosals</h4>
Phantom<br> 
Phantom Aerosol has quickly become one of the most popular bed bug aerosols on the market with a great residual proven to kill bed bugs even after fully dry. We have chosen to only carry the aerosol form of Phantom as we feel it performs better than its non-aerosol form. Phantom is not a repellant meaning bed bugs are not deterred from crossing over the insecticide. In fact, bed bugs don’t even know they’re crossing over it. Phantom does take up to 7 days to work so we suggest using a good contact killer such as our STERI-FAB, Bedlam or JT Eaton Kills Bed Bugs (red) along with Phantom.<p>

Phantom is a residual and is effective for between 7-14 days. We suggest a total of 3 applications every 10 days along cracks, crevices, baseboards, below and behind furniture as well as other areas where bed bugs may be hiding or cross over. Always read and adhere to the instructions on the products label to ensure proper and safe usage.<p>

<h4>Dusts</h4>
Tech Dust<br> 
TyraTech™ TechDust™ is a natural dust developed and tested by industry professionals specifically for use by industry professionals.  TechDust™ delivers:<p>
<ul>
<li>A new mode of action managing pest resistance and resistant populations</li>
<li>An EPA-exempt product that is comparable to or better than synthetic industry standards containing pyrethroids</li>
<li>Superior performance over other natural/EPA-exempt dust products</li><p>
</ul>
Cimexa<br> 
CimeXa is made up of a unique silica powder, which destroys the waxy cuticle of insects, causing rapid dehydration and death. CimeXa has been shown to kill bed bugs over three times faster than diatomaceous earth, and offers a better consistency as well.<p>


CimeXa can be applied as a dust, like diatomaceous earth, or can be mixed with water and applied as a spray. Once it's applied, CimeXa can remain effective for up to 10 years as long as it's left undisturbed.<p>
