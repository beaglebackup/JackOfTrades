<h1>Bed Bug Recommendations</h1>

<p>

<p><strong>PREVENTION.</strong>  Some pest proofing practices can inhibit the harborage and spread of bed bugs, although most prevention for bed bugs is mostly cultural and based upon the practices of the people inhabiting the space.<p>

Property managers can prevent pest harborage by addressing any structural deficiencies, especially cracks and crevices.  Bed bugs can fit in an area narrow enough to fit a credit card.  By sealing up cracks and crevices the number of places bed bugs have to hide are reduced, making detection and treatment much easier.  Specific attention should be paid to the baseboards and carpet edges, although any structural deficiencies creating small openings should be addressed for bed bugs as well as other pests. In multi-unit buildings, bed bug infestations can spread to other locations via active transport through wall voids at electrical outlets, pipe opening and heating ducts. While these typically can’t be sealed closed, any deficiencies (cracked plating, excessive opening, etc.) should be noted and corrected.<p> 

Mattress and box spring encasements are also a type of pest proofing. Encasements remove potential harborage areas by providing a flat surface, instead of the numerous hiding spaces on mattresses or in box springs. Encasements are typically bright white in color and make any bed bugs or evidence easily visible. If there are any current bed bugs harboring on the mattress or box spring, encasements seal them in and prevent them from feeding. Climbup interceptors are also considered prevention since they don’t allow bed bugs to access the bed from other points in the room.<p>   

Bed bugs are attracted to body heat and carbon dioxide not poor sanitation, but clutter does drastically increase the number of places for bed bugs to harbor. Clutter reduction, especially in the bed area, is always recommended for preventing and controlling bed bug infestation. Items should not be stored under the bed. Any items that are stored near the bed should not be stored in cardboard, but instead should be in locking plastic containers as they reduce harborage areas.<p> 

The best way to prevent bringing a bed bug infestation is through education and conscious preventative precautions on the part of the tenant. Bed bugs can come from a number of locations, including (but not limited to) hotels, theaters, libraries, offices, public transportation, used furniture/clothing items, and infested residential locations. Extra precautions should be taken in these locations, including visually inspecting furniture before sitting on it, not putting personal bags on furniture, and bagging and laundering any clothing items worn as soon as arriving home. If bed bug are known to be in other units of the building, non infested units should install interceptors and encasements for prevention and early detection.<p>
