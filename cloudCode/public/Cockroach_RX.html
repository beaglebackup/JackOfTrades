<h1>IPM STRATEGIES FOR COCKROACH INFESTATIONS</h1>
<p><strong>MONITORING.</strong> "One of the most important steps in a cockroach integrated pest management (IPM) program is decision-making. Homeowners and business owners look to their pest management professionals to make informed decisions about the need to apply treatments for cockroaches and. based on need, the best measures available. Monitoring is the strategy providing the information necessary to make these decisions. Key aspects 01 monitoring include:</p>
<ul><li>
Identification</li>
<li>
Inspection, including use of flushing agents and monitoring traps</li>
<li>
Prediction</li>
<li>
Evaluation</li>
<li>
Decision</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>IDENTIFICATION.</strong> In the past, the term &quot;think like a cockroach&quot; has been used to successfully implement control of these pests. Proper identification of the infesting cod roach species is the first step in monitoring, understanding, and ultimately controlling the infestation. The previous part of this chapter provides the necessary information for pest professionals to identify and understand the biology of the major and incidental cockroach pests. In most cases, adult cockroach species are easily identified. However, professionals must not be complacent with their identifications. For example, Koehler et al. (1990) reported that before the Asian cockroach was identified in the United States, mar pest control companies in Tampa, Fla., were applying insecticides ineffectively in 1 attempt to control &quot;German&quot; cockroaches. It took an alert pest management profession who was suspicious that the behavior of the &quot;German&quot; cockroach he was supposed to I controlling was not the same as he had seen or read about. Consequently, he sent specimens to specialists for identification, which turned out to be the Asian cockroach. With­ «it this curiosity and observation, this species of cockroach new to North America might lave gone undetected for several more years.</p>

<p>Immature stages of cockroaches can be difficult to identify. American, smoky brown, Oriental, and other larger species of cockroaches have early nymphal stages that may be tie same size and could be mistaken for predominantly indoor species such as German or brownbanded cockroaches. In southern areas, the peridomestic species are primarily out­ roar pests, so insecticide application to building interiors is usually not necessary. Thus, it is very important to identify the species and to understand its biology and habits before determining a course of treatment.</p>



<p><strong>INSPECTION.</strong> Cockroaches are cryptic and often go unnoticed until populations are so large the potential for contamination or possible health problems, such as allergies, be­ comes apparent. The premises must be inspected to properly identify all the cockroach rests and to determine the extent of the infestation. In areas where peridomestic cock­ roaches are present, the inspection must include a search of potential outdoor harbor­ ages and entry points. Ultimately, the food, water, and harborage essential to the survival of cockroach populations should be found.  Sources of reinfestation such as incoming goods, must be Identified along With conducive conditions, such as inadequate sanitation, leaking water pipes, and excessive outdoor vegetation. In addition, any sensitive situations should be noted, such as children, pets, fish tanks, and sensitive electronic equipment, such as computers, fire alarms, etc.</p>

<p>
Inspection for cockroaches usually involves visual inspection, often with use of a pyrethrin flushing agent to locate cockroach hiding places. A thorough knowledge of preferred habitats of cockroach species will help determine potential harborage sites. Monitoring traps are frequently used 10 augment visual observations.</p>

<p>A bright flashlight is a must for inspections. Use of a mirror to inspect difficult-to-see spots and a willingness to climb high and low, in­ side and outside, also are essential to deter­ mine the extent and location of cockroach infestations. Client cooperation is generally crucial for long-term success. The pest management service professional should explain the importance of thorough inspections and request the customer make all area: of the structure accessible. The reduction of clutter, for example, is one of the keys to effective long-term control of cockroaches.</p>

<p>
Customers may also assist with the inspection and monitoring process through reporting or logging pest sightings, thus documenting the exact time and location. Client re porting or requests for service have been suggested as important pest surveillance methods to successfully achieve policy goals of large-scale IPM programs for public building: (Greene and Breisch 2002a).</p>

<p>
Many professionals use pyrethrin aerosols, also called flushing agents, to flush cock roaches from infested machinery and other harborages. However, pyrethrins can scatte and repel cockroaches to non infested areas (Reierson and Rust 1977; Owens 1980), so the service professional should consider this possibility prior to using flushing agents.</p>

<p>
Monitoring traps are highly useful tools for inspection, both indoors and outdoors When traps were compared with other methods of surveillance, they were found to hi less disruptive of cockroach populations and provided a more realistic estimate of population size for German cockroaches (Owens 1980; Owens and Bennett 1983), and for peridomestic cockroaches (Baker and Southam 1977; Brenner and Patterson 1988). Commercially available sticky traps or rodent glue traps are the types most often used by the public and the pest control industry. Most of these sticky traps are baited with attractive food substances, while some incorporate Ger­man cockroach excreta or aggregation pheromone as an attractant (Miller et al. 1996; Goldstein 1996; Kaakeh and Bennett 1997a). Recent studies indicate
that food-based lures may be more effective in attracting German cockroaches to traps than aggregation pheromone-based lures (Nalyanya and Schal 2001; Smith aru Appel 2002).</p>

<p>
Researchers often use glass jar traps (quart size or smaller) coated on the inside upper surface with a band of petroleum jelly to prevent escape. This method was developed from work done in 1969 by Mallis, who successfully trapped American and Germai cockroaches through the use of empty, gallon tin cans greased in a similar manner. Like Mallis, many researchers today still bait their traps with a piece of white bread wetted with beer. The can/jar is then placed in a dark corner so that its outer surface is in contact with two walls. The number of traps used depends on the infestation. These traps an usually set up in the evening and the cockroaches are collected in the morning. Beside beer and bread, dehydrated potatoes mixed with sucrose and water (Miesch 1964), Coca Cola&quot; syrup and bananas (Reierson 1977), and distiller&#39;s grain (Brenner and Pattersoi 1988) are a few of the items tested as cockroach attractants. Even captured cockroaches have been used by researchers as an attractant for other cockroaches (Appel 1994), but there is no evidence for attractiveness or repellency of captured cockroaches in traps (Appel 1998).</p>

<p>
Use of traps to eliminate a German cockroach population within large structures is realistic (Ballard and Gold 1984). However, traps may provide some benefit in removing peridomestic cockroaches from areas outdoors before they enter structures (Piper ei 1975; Piper and Frankie 1978; Moore and Granovsky 1983). Traps can also pro ... insight into the cockroach population structure, movement, distribution, and den (Owens 1980; Runstrom and Bennett 1990; Smith et al. 1997; Appel 1998; Brenner e 1998). Cockroaches are gregarious: aggregation is most pronounced for small nymphs especially for German cockroaches (Ross et al. 1984; Runstrom and Bennett 1990). Thus traps with a large percentage of small nymphs are likely near prime harborages for cc roaches and the deposition of their egg capsules. These sites are also likely to con adult gravid females (DeMark and Bennett 1995). Such an area should be a focal point for control strategies and future monitoring of any recurring infestations. Additional formation on using traps for control appears later in this chapter.</p>

<p>
Key reasons for using traps as monitoring tools have been discussed by Koehler e (1990) and Ballard and Gold (1992). Summarizing their findings. traps can be used the following purposes:</p>

<ul><li>
To detect and identify the cockroach pests present.</li>
<li>
To detect low-level populations before a population explosion takes place.</li>
<li>
To locate or pinpoint problem areas, entry points, or harborages for targeted control measures.</li>
<li>
To document the effectiveness of control strategies by comparing pretreatment counts to post-treatment trap counts.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>PREDICTION.</strong> After implementing monitoring strategies, including proper identification and thorough inspection, a professional should have the necessary knowledge eliminate the cockroach infestation and predict when and where cockroach infestation may recur. The basic concept of prediction is that population levels of any pest are constant and change through lime. Seasonality or time of year usually has the great impact on cockroach abundance. Even with indoor cockroach species, populations decrease during winter and will usually increase during summer when temperature relative humidity increase. As populations grow larger, human contact with cockroach also increases, thus providing more necessity to implement control measures. Prediction of infestation allows control measures to be applied before customers decide to change pest control companies or the home or business requires extensive treatment, Professionals should rely on their past experience and treatment records to predict when cockroach populations tend to peak in their area. Such a strategy works best with peridomestic species.</p>

<p>
In addition to seasonal changes, building and landscape characteristics can be use help predict cockroach population trends and movement. Experienced professionals often have insight regarding buildings most prone to cockroach problems. Over t patterns of activity will emerge within any building - home or business. In some situations, cockroach infestations are easy to predict due to obvious structural and sanitation issues. In other cases, however, especially with peridomestic species, inspection and predieting population trends and movement may prove more challenging. The areas in which peridomestic species harbor in and around homes may be too numerous and widespread to inspect.</p>

<p>
Several researchers have investigated building and landscape characteristics that can help professionals predict where inaccessible cockroach harborages may be and which outdoor cockroaches may reinfest a structure (Brenner I 988a; Smith et al. 1995a, 1995b In north central Florida, Brenner (1988a) found that smoky brown cockroaches were strongly concentrated in palms, trees with treeholes, woodpiles, and various mulches. In Auburn, Ala., Smith et al. (1995a) found that the relative abundance of smokybrown could be estimated using 18 house and landscape characteristics. For example. homes with the 1110st smokybrown cockroaches tended to be more than 40 years old with a brick exterior, several outbuildings, pets, and many hardwood trees ill a densely populate neighborhood. In Clemson, S.c., Benson (1987) investigated characteristics of a home conducive to American and smokybrown harborages. Ln this study, both species tended to
harbor around moist areas such as pipes, but srnokybrown cockroaches were distributed widely throughout the structure, including the attic.</p>

<p>
Sometimes, even though pest management professionals do a good job of prediction, long-term cooperation by customers is lacking. After an initial inspection and treatment the customer may restrict the service professional's access to the building or areas of the building. Commercial food establishments may Limit access to liquor cabinets and food lockers while nursing homes and hospitals may restrict access to drug storage closet Homeowners and apartment residents may prevent access by placing new or multipJe locks on their exterior doors. If access to possible harborage sites is denied, the professional should communicate to the client that adequate control of the cockroach infestation cannot be assured.</p>

<p>
Prediction is often overlooked in urban IPM programs. However, prediction of cockroach population trends and movement can eliminate the need for some treatments. Pest management professionals who not only identify current problems but also predict and intercept future problems will distinguish themselves by providing long-term results for their customers.</p>

<p><strong>EVALUATION.</strong> Another important aspect of monitoring is periodic evaluation of the IPM program. Lack of timely follow-up and evaluation can result in program failure and lost customers. Prior to performing any service, the service professional should personally review the service plan with the customer and address any concerns he or she may have. After the se vice, a follow-up meeting to review the results and answer questions will likely enhance a customer&#39;s peace of­ mind and confidence that the infestation has been effectively and safely controlled (Fig. 2-31). In the event the customer is not satisfied, appropriate steps must be take quickly to remedy the concern to the customer&#39;s satisfaction. Timely and proactive communication is important in overall customer satisfaction with a cockroach control program.</p>

<p>
Continued monitoring and inspection are particularly necessary for German cock­ aches, as eggs or other stages may be reintroduced with incoming goods, personal belongings, or from neighboring areas. Apartment buildings and restaurants are two examples where continued monitoring and service are especially warranted to provide a cockroach-free environment.</p>



<p><strong>DECISION.</strong> In most cases, no single tool will provide complete suppression of cockroach populations. The professional must evaluate the information and make decisions based on the pest species, the extent of the infestation, available chemical and nonchemical controls, cost effectiveness, areas to be treated, and attitudes of the customer as to which tools they will accept. Sensitive situations must also be considered, such as the presence of children, pets (including birds. fish, and reptiles), and items that may be affected by certain formulations. Sensitive sites requiring careful monitoring and minimal pesticide applications include animal rearing rooms, pet stores, zoos, schools, daycare centers, computer rooms, food areas of food handling establishments, hospitals, nursing homes, and 24-hour supermarkets and restaurants.</p>

<p>
Someday, pest management professionals may be aided by computerized decision support systems in the field. Bao and Robinson (1993) developed a knowledge-based computer system for the management of American cockroaches. This system provided inked recommendations for American cockroach control based on a number of biotic and abiotic factors. Brenner et al. (1998) described in detail the practical use of spatial .analysis and contour mapping of insect populations, including cockroaches, so that pest interventions can be applied precisely and minimally. Such computer assisted methods are potential to define pest distribution and provide pest management professionals with documentable procedures for targeting cockroaches and other pests with reduced pesticide.</p>



<p><strong>NONCHEMICAL STRATEGIES.</strong> Nonchemical methods help control cockroaches while educing the amount of insecticides applied and improving the efficacy of insecticides then they are needed. This section will discuss a variety of nonchemical strategies under the following topics:</p>
<ul><li>
Sanitation.</li>

<li>
Harborage alteration, including removal and denial. Exclusion, including barrier treatments and interception. Physical removal, including trapping and vacuuming. Biological control.</li>

<li>
Miscellaneous, including sterilization, radiation, and ultrasound, etc.</li>

</ul>

<p><h6>Sanitation.</h6> Like all animals, cockroaches need food and water to survive in and around structures. By reducing access to food and water, cockroach populations become stressed to survive in urban environments (Jackson and Marsh 1978). Conversely, poor sanitation, inadequate maintenance, and overcrowding in apartments can create chronic cockroach infestations (Todaro 1984). Once German cockroach populations are established, it can be impossible to reduce the population by sanitation alone (Owens 1980: Bertholf 1983 Other control methods must be integrated into the control program for significant population reduction (Bennett (1984).</p>

<p>
Even when sanitation is excellent, no situation exists indoors where cockroach food: some form is not available (Marsh and Bertholf 1986). But when sanitation is integrate with other control strategies, such as residual treatments and baits, cockroaches are more likely to contact insecticide residues since they have to spend more time foraging for foe and water (Schal and Hamilton 1990). Gupta et al. (1973, 1975) found that insecticide treatments were more effective in homes with good sanitation. In addition, Rust and Reierson (1988) found that the effect of some pyrethroid insecticides is reduced whe applied onto oily surfaces. Schal (1988) found greater efficacy of the pyrethro cypermethrin in clean rather than cluttered, greasy apartments.</p>

<p>
Water is a limiting factor for cockroaches in modern houses and restaurants (Corn Well 1968) and is likely the reason many in­ door German cockroach infestations are confined to kitchens and bathrooms. Common sources of water for cockroaches are the traps of sinks and tubs, toilet bowls, condensation on pipes, and plumbing leaks. Pet water dishes (and pet food) left out 24 hours a day is an ideal situation exploited by cock­ roaches. Refrigerators often provide a constant source of moisture since, dur­ing the defrost cycle, water drains into
pans under the appliance; condensation around door seals also can provide cockroaches plenty of moisture. House plants require frequent watering and the soil retain moisture for long periods of time, therefore extending cockroach infestations from t kitchen and bathrooms to virtually every room in the house and into atriums in commercial buildings,</p>

<p>
In summary, every effort should be made to reduce sources of cockroach food a water. Although not effective by itself, sanitation will enhance virtually every other cockroach management tool. A professional should continually look for potential cockroach food and water sources and point these out to the customer. The customer greatly assist the professional by providing a schedule of cleaning, proper food storage, regular disposal of garbage, and prompt repair of water leaks (Hedges 1991).</p>

<p><h6>Harborage Alteration.</h6> In conjunction with food and water, harborage is the third essential element for cockroaches to survive. Predominately indoor pests, such as Gem cockroaches and brown banded cockroaches, can abound in cluttered homes and apartments. Clutter is excellent harborage for cockroaches and often provides areas of hi humidity that are difficult to clean and access (Koehler et al. 1987). This sort of harborage is also an ideal site for cockroaches to hide during and after insecticide treatments peridomestic cockroaches often harbor in a wide variety of habitats around structures. American and oriental cockroaches often infest sewers, basements, and crawlspaces, particularly around pipes (Cornwell 1968). Smokybrown cockroaches may be found in a variety of harborage sites including treeholes, woodpiles, brickpiles, various mulches, .d areas in a home where water collects (Benson 1987; Brenner 1988a; Smith et at. 195a).</p>

<p>
Harborage alteration for indoor cockroaches often entails removal of materials such paper bags and cardboard boxes, newspapers, excessive household goods, litter, and iy other items resulting in clutter. In restaurants, an important step is the removal of all cardboard boxes. For outdoor cockroaches. removal of clutter in basements and crawlspaces, woodpiles, exces­sive mulch, and thick vegetation such as ivy around and on homes is often required to reduce pest populations.</p>

<p>
Alteration can also include the removal of factors that make a harborage suitable for cockroaches. For example, smokybrown cockroaches are particularly sensitive to moisture loss through the cuticle, and thus re­ quire liquid water every two to three days (Appel 1986). Detailed studies on the spatial distribution in South Carolina (Benson L988) and in Florida (Brenner 1988a, 1988b) have indicated that smokybrown cockroach populations are centered on habitats that can be described as protected, moist, dark, relatively warm, and fairly free from the desiccating effects of air flow (e.g., poorly ventilated attics). Brenner (1988a) found that reduction of moisture in 1 attic by installing proper ventilation causes most smokybrown cockroaches to leave, and new cockroaches will be less likely to enter.</p>

<p>
Harborage denial is employed for permanent harborages that cannot be changed or removed. Denial is most often accomplished by sealing holes and cracks leading to harborage sites. This should reduce available harborage and the potential number of cockroaches: however, care must be taken when caulking openings. Sealing harborages that 111 easily be monitored and treated may force cockroaches to move to more secluded and protected areas. Farmer and Robinson (1984) demonstrated that harborage reduction &#39;I caulking cracks and crevices may not reduce German cockroach populations when food is abundant. Thus, it is important to employ other control strategies when using harborage denial. Hedges (1991) recommended that cracks should first be treated with a residual dust insecticide prior to sealing. Sealing following treatment is a standard guide­ ne required in facilities monitored by the United States Department of Agriculture.</p>


<h6>Exclusion.</h6> Keeping pests from entering a structure from the outside is known as exclusion. This key component of IPM is generally accomplished by sealing cracks and removing entry points used by peridomestic cockroach. The case for exclusion is best illustrate with the smokybrown cockroach. In some areas the southeastern United States, individual family dwellings are invaded nightly by smokybrown cockroaches (Koehler et al. 1990). Treatment of the inside. of homes does little to solve these infestations because cockroaches continue to invade from outside. The be long-term solution for the smokybrown cockroach to prevent entry into the home (Story 1986). Weather proofing of doors and windows, caulking cracks ill crevices, sealing plumbing, trimming trees and shrubs close to the house, and screening windows and art vents are all important exclusion tasks.</p>

<p>
A barrier (perimeter) strategy applied to the foundation and ground around buildings is helpful in reducing peridomestic cockroach entry (Piper and Frankie 1978 ; Brenner an Pierce 1991) smith et al.</p>
(1995a) found that the most effective barrier strategy consisted of an integrated approach using monitoring of harborage location, baits, targeted insecticide sprays, and landscape modification. Using a variety of exclusion methods minimizes the amount of insecticide treatments needed inside the building - a factor greatly appreciated by many customers in these pesticide conscious times.</p>

<p>
Interception is a form of exclusion usually directed at German cockroaches. Interception involves a quarantine process, performed most often at food plants, which is performed by the customer (Hedges 1991). Instructed by the pest management professions the customer establishes a method and routine of inspecting incoming boxes and other items to ensure cockroaches are not being carried into the building. Customers at office buildings and restaurants can also help exclude German cockroaches by establishing policies prohibiting employees from bringing in personal items, such as radios or other items, that may harbor cockroaches.</p>



<p>
<h6>Physical Removal.</h6> Many pest management professionals consider trapping to be It most effective means of physical removal of cockroaches. Haber (1919) recognized It importance of trapping more than 80 years ago, but he stated such methods are often overemphasized as a method of control. He described one of several trapping methods; follows: &quot;At night put old cloths dampened with dishwater in the sink or near their runways and places of seclusion. Darken the room and leave it. At 30- or 45-minute intervals return with a liberal supply of scalding hot water and dash it upon the cloths, thus destroying many cockroaches which have secluded themselves in the folds of the cloth (beneath it.&quot;</p>

<p>
More than 60 years ago, Gould (1943) reported the use of traps as a recent development for cockroach control. Electrical traps as reported by Burgess et al. (1974) corralled 12,000 German cockroaches in a hospital canteen during one year. Barak et al, (1977), using traps as a method of control, found greater success with oriental cockroaches than German cockroaches. With trapping, the greater the reproductive capacity of the cock­ ach is, the less significant the impact in reducing the population. Where the cock­ aches have numerous cracks and crevices in which to hide and adequate alternative od sources, traps also proved less effective. Ballard and Gold (1984) found the use of traps to eliminate German cockroaches in a large structure was not realistic. However, with peridomestic cockroaches, traps may provide some benefit by removing these pests fore they enter a structure (piper et al. 1975; Piper and Frankie 1978; Moore and Ranovsky 1983). Still, as previously discussed, most professionals find traps more use­ I for monitoring programs than as a control strategy.</p>



<p>
<h6>Vacuuming.</h6> A technique for physical removal of cockroaches gaining greater in­ rest in the pest management industry is vacuuming. In 1966, Wright developed a technique of collecting live German and brown banded cockroaches via a modified vacuum cleaner. In 1995, edges reviewed the benefits of cockroach removal using a vacuum device. Benefits : vacuuming include:</p>

<ul><li>
An immediate impact on the cock­roach population.</li>

<li>
Reduces the reproductive potential of the population. </li>

<li>
Removes both susceptible and insecticide-resistant cockroaches.</li>

<li>
Can be accomplished without vacating the premises.</li>

<li>
Reduces the number of dead or dying cockroaches the customers will see.</li>

<li>
Reduces the level of allergens present when a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter is used on the vacuum.</li>

</ul>

Hedges (I995b) found that one of the best situations in which to use a vacuum is during initial treatment in homes or facilities where the cockroach population is at a moderate to high level. In conjunction with flushing agents that can move cockroaches &quot;from deep harborages, vacuuming can be very effective (Kaakeh and Bennett I 997b). or professionals considering this control method, three important requirements for vacuums should be considered. First, is the vacuum small enough to be maneuvered easily e.g., a backpack device)? Second, does it have the ability to withstand accidental suction f water? This is a distinct possibility, especially when using such devices in commercial kitchens. Third, and very important for pest management professionals, does the vacuum have a HEPA filter? Without a HEPA filter, cockroach exoskeletons, feces, and other allergens will be removed from protected sites and become airborne, causing potential health problems for residents or workers.</p>



<h6>Biological Control.</h6> Cockroaches are susceptible to a wide variety of natural enemies including predators, such as other insects, arachnids, and vertebrates, and parasites • pathogens such as nematodes, protozoa, and fungi (Roth and Willis 1954, 1960; Guthrie and Tindall 1968; Slater et al. 1980; Slater 1984; Coler et al. 1984; Suiter 1997). To date biological control in urban environments has had mixed success. Biological agents US!; to control cockroaches must also stay alive to be effective. Any insecticides used to control cockroaches often also kill cockroach predators and parasites. Also, biological agents generally are not well adapted to survive in urban environments. Low relative humidity and varied indoor conditions present hardships for cockroach pathogens and predators (Schal and Hamilton 1990). Cockroaches are also very good at avoiding and surviving predatory and pathogenic attacks. In addition, human tolerance to other insects is gene ally low. Without educational programs, insects released in the urban environment control cockroaches are also considered pests (Thoms and Robinson 1986, 1987c). Still, the search for viable biological control agents for cockroaches continues. In recent years, research on biological control for cockroaches has focused on fungi, nematodes, and parasitoid wasps.</p>



<p>
Fungi. Research detailing lethal fungal infection in cockroaches includes Archbold et ; (1986, 1987a, I 987b), Appel et al. (1987), Kaakeh et al. (1996), and Mohan et al. (199l One of the most effective fungal pathogens is Metarhizium anisopiiae, a fungus t[­ occurs naturally in soil. Metarhizium anisopliae thrives only in high relative humidity, commercial stations containing the fungus are most effective against cockroaches who placed in dark humid areas. The fungus adheres to cockroaches entering the static eventually killing them, and may also be transferred from one cockroach to another through contact.</p>



<p>
Nematodes. Stelnernema carpocapsae (Weiser) is a nematode (roundworm) that infer and kills various insects, including cockroaches (Corpus and Sikorowski 1992; Koeh et al. 1992; Appel et al. 1993; Appel and Benson 1994). Similar to M. anisopliae, this roundworm must be cultured in dark, moist stations and placed in areas frequented cockroaches. In laboratory studies, Corpus and Sikorowski (1992) were able to kill 93% of brown cockroaches exposed to S. carpocapsae. Koehler et al. (1992) reported the German, brownbanded, oriental, and smokybrown cockroaches all died within one d after forced exposure to S. carpocapsae. The cockroaches were observed actively grooming nematodes from their legs and antennae. When tested in apartments against Germ cockroaches, Appel et al. (1993) were able to achieve up to 67% control using carpocapsaeladen stations. This study concluded that improvement in station design better retain moisture and placement should improve efficacy.</p>



<p>
Parasites. Many species of mites are found in association with insects. As parasites, mites do not cause mortality but may reduce reproduction and longevity in their he Mites of the genus Pimeliaphilus have been known to destroy laboratory colonies cockroaches (Field et al. 1966), and Blattisocius tineivorus (Oudemans), a predaceous mite, has been shown to cause decline of German cockroach colonies (Roth and Willis (1960). Mites are generally not considered to have potential as a practical biological control agent due to the elevated temperatures and dry conditions under which they develop. A number of wasps, sometimes referred to as parasitoids, are known to lay their eggs the egg capsules of cockroaches, ultimately killing them. Slater et al. (1980) demonstrated that multiple releases of the encyrtid wasp Comperia merceti (Compere), could control brown banded cockroaches in large buildings. But continued releases of wasps should be necessary at low cockroach population densities (Coler et al. 1984).</p>
<p>
Fleet and Frankie (1975) and Piper et al. (1978) found another wasp, Aprostocetus Tetrastichus) hagenowii, was the most prevalent biological control organism of peridomesric cockroaches in the genus Periplaneta. Parasites emerged from up to 68% of oothecae collected from field sites in Texas and Louisiana. Piper and Frankie (1978) found that perimeter sprays used to control cockroaches also controlled the parasite. Haigenbuch et al. (1988b) reported a method of mass-producing Aprostocetus hagenowii the laboratory for field release. Multiple releases of these laboratory reared parasites provided up to 98% parasitism of American cockroach oothecae in experimental kitchens (Hagenbuch et al. 1989), Aprostocetus hagenowii is known to attack egg capsules in e American, brown, srnokybrown, Australian, brownbanded, oriental, and Florida woods cockroach. Both Hagenbuch et al. (1989) and Pawson and Gold (1993) speculated that ~ potential exists for A. hagenowii to control the American cockroach. A related parasitoid species, A. asthenogmus, also has potential as biological control for peridomestic cokroaches (Shamim et al. 2001).</p>
<p>
Patterson et al. (1988) and Hagenbuch et al. (1989) determined that the integration of Piramethylnon baits into a control program for American cockroaches did not adversely feet the parasite Aprostocetus hagenowii. Because the bait was consumed by nymphs id adults of the cockroach and the parasites attacked the egg stage, rapid reduction in ickroach populations resulted with no reinfestation by egg hatch. Therefore, the integration of baits with biological control offers control of all three life stages of the cockroach: egg. nymph, and adult.</p>
<p>
Thoms and Robinson (1986) found that oriental cockroach populations in Virginia were being suppressed by an ensign wasp (Evaniidae). The wasp naturally Occurs in areas not treated with insecticides. Educational programs with residents of housing complexes were successful in changing attitudes about the presence of this rather large parasite. At the beginning of the study, many residents wanted to kill the wasp that emerged from the egg capsule. But after explaining that the wasp attacks and kills cockroach eggs, residents were willing to tolerate the presence of the biological control organism.</p>
<p>
Predators. Historically, other biological control agents for cockroaches have been re­ported. More than 80 years ago, Shipley (19 J 6) reported the intentional introduction of hedgehogs to reduce cockroach populations. Marlatt (1908) found it worthy to report that tree frogs left in a room overnight would effectively rid the premises. Tree frogs have been seen eating large numbers of Asian cockroaches in Tampa, Fla. (Koehler et al. 990). Monkeys and turtles have been reported eating cockroaches at zoological parks. gecko lizards are sometimes purchased to control cockroaches by New York apartment dwellers.</p>




<p>
Crab spiders are known to be predators of German cockroaches and, in the past, hay­ been sold by some biological control firms to consumers. Many of the buyers did not realize that a predator is usually larger than its prey and were very unhappy to receive spiders more than 2.5 inches (6 cm) long to release in their kitchen. The spiders also needed a constant supply of cockroaches to remain alive. It was therefore necessary for It. house to be constantly infested with cockroaches to prevent the spiders from starving to death:</p>

<p>
One predator, the Surinam toad, Pipa pipa, which has been introduced into a number of cockroach-infested islands, has shown both a palate and appetite to become an effective natural enemy of the cockroach.</p>

<p>
Considering the most realistic occurrences and frequency of natural predators of llJ ban cockroaches, the house mouse, Mus domesticus, the Norway rat, Rattus norvegicu. and the roof rat, Rattus rattus, ru&#39;e all aggressive predators on German, American, an oriental cockroaches, and likely any other species they should opportunistically encounter (Roth and Willis 1954; Bertholf 1983; Corrigan 1997). Rodents frequently consume cockroaches captured on insect monitoring traps. However, the great reproductive potential of the cockroach, its ability to adapt and protect itself, its omnivorous appetite, an the scarcity of effective natural enemies guarantees its survival despite these biologic. control efforts.</p>

<p>
Probably the most important factor in the success of biological control of cockroaches may be human acceptance of the agent, a factor directly related to its visibility (Suit, 2001). The presence of cockroach predators or parasites is likely to be viewed as unsightly as the existing cockroach infestation, as evidenced by Thoms and Robinson (198 1987c), when residents of infested dwellings often killed oothecal parasites.</p>

<h6>Miscellaneous Nonchemical Methods.</h6> This final category for nonchemical control, cockroaches includes sterilization and radiation techniques, and review of ultrasound devices. The concept of sterilizing cockroaches with chemicals or radiation gained popularity as a concept during the I 960s after the screwworm fly was successfully eradicate from Florida and subsequently from the United States (Knipling 1979). In 1963, Burde and Smittle first reported on the effect of chemosterilants against German cockroaches Kenaga (1965a, 1965b) showed several triphenyl tin compounds partially suppress. reproduction in German cockroaches when fed to nymphs. Frishman (1968) was able sterilize both sexes of German cockroaches with oral, dermal, and residual deposits the chemosterilant TEPA [tris (l-aziridinyl) phosphine oxide]. The relative danger these compounds and related compounds to humans and other animals curtailed research in this area of urban entomology.</p>

<p>
Mortality after exposure to UV radiation was exhibited in five species of cockroach (Cohen et al. 1973). Experimentation with ionizing radiation on German cockroach also was attempted (Cole et al. 1959; Ross and Cochran 1963). The development a release of genetically sterilized male German cockroaches to achieve control has be the subject of research on naval vessels (Ross et al. 1981).</p>

<p>
The early use of sterile insect methods of controlling cockroaches was unsuccessful because it required mass production of cockroaches in the laboratory and release in houses, apartments, restaurants, and ships. No one is willing to tolerate the release of such a long-lived pest as the cockroach, In addition, field populations of cockroaches could not be sterilized with the original chemicals tested because the chemicals also affected humans, Consequently, the concept of sterilization and radiation was discontin­ued until the advent of the insect growth regulators. The insect growth regulators essentially render cockroaches sterile and are the best example of using the sterile insect method for pest control in the United States.</p>

<p>
Ultrasound devices have been sold to the public and the pest control industry as a nonchemical method to repel or control cockroaches. The use of ultrasound seemed promising since moths and crickets use sound to communicate or avoid predation. Gold et al. 984) evaluated four commercially available ultrasound devices and found that although they produced ultrasound, their output was less than the manufacturer claimed. They also included that many advertising claims were gross exaggerations. Koehler et al. (1986) evaluated nine commercially available ultrasound pest control devices and concluded at manufacturers&#39; claims of cockroach and flea control could not be substantiated."</p>
