Beetle</h1>

<h2>Family
Dermestidae</h2>

<p>The
warehouse beetle is a cosmopolitan pest commonly found in stores of
food products, especially in the warmer climates of the U.S. Larvae
have been found infesting cereals, seeds of all kinds, corn meal,
dried dog food, milk powder, dried spices, fishmeal, pasta noodles,
cookies, and candy, among numerous other products.  They can also
feed on dead insects and dry animal carcasses.  Adults feed on pollen
and do relatively no other damage.</p>

<p><strong>Description.</strong>
 The adults are oval in shape, brownish-black and approximately 1/8
inch (3 mm) long.  The elytra have a pattern of light brown on a dark
brown base and are covered with hairs.  Larvae grow to Â¼ inch (6 mm)
long and are covered with short and long hairs.  Short hairs are
clustered in four pairs of dense patches on the last four segments. 
The color ranges from yellow-white to dark brown.</p>

<p><strong>Life History.</strong>  Unlike
the Khapra beetle, the warehouse beetle is an excellent flier and has
been caught in traps 35 feet high and several hundreds of feet from
an infestation source.  The adults prefer to breed in dark places,
and can often be found in the hollow spaces of ceiling, and walls in
processing and storage facilities.  Males undergo five molts while
the females will have six molts in favorable conditions before
becoming pupae.  Several generations can occur per year.
