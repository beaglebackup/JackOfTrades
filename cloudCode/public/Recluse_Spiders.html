brown recluse spider, Loxosceles reclusa, is one of 13 Loxosceles
species now known to occur in the United States (Breene 1997b).  At
the beginning of the 20</font><sup><font face="Avenir Book, serif">th</font></sup><font face="Avenir Book, serif">
century, only two species were recorgnized – L. rufescens and L.
unicolor (Comstock 1912).  Gerstsch and Emnick (1983) reported that
the brown spiders of the genus Loxoceles (also known as violin or
fiddle-back spiders because of the violin-shaped marking on the
carapace of some species) are known from two principal world areas:
temperate South Africa northward through the tropics into the
Mediterranean region and southern Europe; and temperate and tropical
zones of North and South America.</font></p>

 The natural range of the brown recluse spider, L. reclusa is from
southern Texas north to Nebraska, and east to eastern Tennessee and
Alabama.  It appears to be most highly concentrated in the
south-central portion of the Mid-West.  Although reports of brown
recluse spiders outside its natural range from Maine to California
have occurred, these are more likely due to transport of commerce or
domestic household goods.   In California, fewer than 10 cases of L.
reclusa have been confirmed  (Vetter 2000b).  Specimens collected in
California are usually the desert recluse, L. deserta, whose presence
inside buildings is less common and whose bite is less toxic.</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">In
addition, many misidentifications of brown recluse spiders occur in
the absence of a specimen simply based upon examination of wounds in
skin.  Physicians may be too quick to decide that an open ulcerous
wound is the result of a brown recluse spider bite, even in those
areas where this species is not known to occur:  Such
misidentifications “can lead to delays in appropriate care” if
specific treatments are available for the actual cause of the would
(Vetter 2002a).</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Within
its range, the brown recluse naturally occurs in outdoor situations,
living in piles of debris, utility boxes, wood piles, and vehicles,
as well as under bark, logs, and stones.  It has adapted quite well
to indoor habitats where it is commonly found harboring in storage
areas, such as closets, attics, crawlspaces, cellars, and other dark
recesses.  They frequently inhabit clothing, boxes, toys, papers,
furniture, and other household items and seem to prefer “layered”
situations, such as stacks of items or clutter.</font></p>

HABITS.</b></font></font><font face="Avenir Book, serif">  The brown
recluse spiders are nocturnal and search for food such as silverfish,
cockroaches, crickets, or other soft-bodied species.  At first light,
wandering spiders will normally return to their retreat of an
irregularly spun, off-white web with their prey.  Males wander
farther than females (Hedges and Lacey 1995) and are the sex that
most commonly crawls into shoes, trousers, or other clothing; or
under sheets and covers on beds.  Bites occur when a spider hiding in
clothing or bedding is accidentally trapped against the skin.  The
thin, wispy webs of the brown recluse may be seen in drawers, boxes,
shelf, corners, under furniture, or other disturbed areas.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font color="#1f497d"><font face="Avenir Book, serif"><b>LIFE
HISTORY.</b></font></font><font face="Avenir Book, serif">  Hite et
al. (1966) studied the life history of the brown recluse spider. 
After mating, which may occur from February to October within its
natural range, 40 to 50 eggs are deposited in off-white, round,
¼-inch (6 mm) diameter silken cases.  The summer months of May
through August are optimal times for egg production.  From one to two
years; however, four to five years is not uncommon.  The presence of
shed skins (exuviae) and subsequent attachment in and around
residences may be indicative of infestations and enable accurate
identification.  They are relatively long-lived, averaging a two- to
four-year life span (Vetter 2000b).  Additionally, the brown recluse
is “synanthropic” which means its numbers increase when living
within human  dwellings (Vetter and Hedges 2001).  When one brown
recluse is found, numerous spiders usually can be located by visual
inspection or the use of monitoring traps.</font></p>

OF BROWN RECLUSE SPIDERS.</b></font></font><font face="Avenir Book, serif">
 Most Loxosceles possess the characteristic dark brown violin marking
on the dorsal carapace, but in some species or individual specimens
this marking may be faded or absent.  Six eyes are situated in three
pairs arranged in a semicircle pattern.  The body coloration of the
brown recluse spider varies from yellowish to light tan to dark brown
and is covered with a fine pubescence.  The spiderlings resemble
adults in structure but have somewhat lighter coloration and may lack
the violin-shaped marking on the carapace.”</font></p>
