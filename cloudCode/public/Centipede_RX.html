<p><strong>Managing centipedes.</strong>  "Aside from house centipedes, centipedes invade as single individuals and usually only one or two will be seen inside.  Indoors, a larger infestation will often be associated with a moist habitat around a leaky pipe or a damp basement or crawlspace.  These conditions should be corrected, as well as ensuring proper ventilation in basements and crawlspaces.  Outdoors, potential harborages such as old boards, boxes, compost piles, wood piles, stones, leaf litter, grass clippings, etc., should be removed.  Long term prevention can sometimes be accomplished by establishing a 2-foot (60 cm) vegetation-free band around the building foundation.<p>

<p><strong>Insecticide Treatments.</strong>  Like cockroaches, house centipedes commonly reside in cracks and voids.  Treatment of these sites may be made with a residual dust product, such as silica gel or diatomaceous earth.  Spot treatments with a microencapsulated (ME) or wettable powder (WP) product may be needed in crawlspaces and/or basements.  Spot applications of dust product to areas of activity may also be beneficial."<p>
