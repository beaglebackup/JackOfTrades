CHARACTERISTICS</b></font></font><font face="Avenir Book, serif">. 
“Workers are about 2 mm long, monomorphic, and have a two-segmented
petiole.  Their antennae are 12-segmented with a three-segmented
club.  They are yellowish or light brown to reddish, with the tip of
the gaster darkened (Vail et al. 1994)  They have a stinger, but are
unable to sting (Edwards 1986).  Queens are similar in color to
worker but about twice the size.  Due to their small size and color,
Pharaoh ants are often confused with thief ants.  The antennae of a
thief ant, however, are 10-segmented with a two-segmented club.</font></p>

&amp; HABITS.</b></font></font><font face="Avenir Book, serif">  The
Pharaoh ants are “tramp ants,” characterized by their transient
nesting behavior.  Indeed, their notoriety in pest control derives
from their predisposition to “satellite.”  An application of
residual insecticides, for example, ofter triggers the splintering of
a colony into numerous satellite colonies (Vail 1997).  In cases
where treatments are applied repeatedly.  Pharaoh ant infestations
can spread over an entire building.</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Even
without insecticides, a localized infestation of Pharaoh ants can
spread quickly.  Colony budding is a contributing factor, but the
main cause is inadvertent transport by people (Edwards 1986).  The
ants can also forage long distances.  In a military housing complex,
for example, researchers fed them dyed bait and tracked their
movement.  Dyed ants were found as far as 45 meter away from the
bait.  They were found foraging in the vertical and horizontal
dimensions inside the building, as well as outdoors (Vail and
Williams 1994).</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">In
temperate regions, Pharaoh ants nest indoors, but in the tropics they
often nest outdoors.  In their selection of nest sites, they are
opportunistic, occupying any crack or crevice with sufficient warmth
and high humidity.  In houses, they are frequently found in kitchens
and bathrooms near a source of water.  Nests are often located in
inaccessible spots such as interior wall voids, under floor, and
behind baseboards or windowsills.  In institutional facilities, there
are found in kitchens, laundries, boiler rooms, and around toilets,
sinks, heating ducts, and pipes.  They are potentially dangerous in
hospitals because of their ability to transmit disease organisms
(Beatson 1972).</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Pharaoh
ants forage both day and night, often going undetected due to their
small size and cryptic habits.  Their trails, for instance, are often
hidden behind baseboards, cabinets, and walls where the ants are
using wires and pipes to travel, but trails sometimes become evident
when they emerge from electrical outlets and plumbing fixture. 
Outside, trails are found around windows and doorways and following
along the edges of bricks or siding.  In one heavily infested house
in Florida, the trails ran along the gutters and shingles on the
roof, originating from more than 15 separate colonies nesting
underneath the shingles (Hedges 1997).</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Pharaoh
ants are omnivores, feeding on fats, proteins, and carbohydrates
(Edwards 1986).  They scavenge and kill small insects, feeding on
fats, proteins, and carbohydrates (Edwards 1986).  They scavenge and
kill small insects.  To ensure a balanced diet, they have an
“alternation” and “satiation” response to food (Edwards and
Abraham 1990).  Confronted with a choice between carbohydrates and
proteins, colonies prefer he one they have not been feeding upon,
and, when provided a preferred food for an extended period of time,
colonies will then switch to other foods when offered a choice.”</font></p>
