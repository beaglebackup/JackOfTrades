<p><strong>Identifying Characteristics.</strong>  "The workers are 2.4 to 3.3 mm long, and have a one-segmented petiole.  The node on the petiole is flattened and, when viewed from above, it is concealed by the base of the gaster.  These ants are a uniform brown to black, and when crushed, emit a rotten, coconut-like odor (Smith 1965).<p>
<p><strong>Distribution.</strong>  The odorous house ant is found throughout the United States and southern Canada from sea level to higher than 11,000 feet (Wheeler and Wheeler 1986).  It is common in parts of Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, California, and the Pacific Northwest (Hedges 1997), and it is becoming a serious pest in much of the Midwest, and along the mid-Atlantic, especially in Kentucky, Virginia, and New Jersey (Hedges 2002).<p>
<p><strong>Biology and Habits.</strong>  The colonies range in size from 2,000 to 10,000 ants (Snelling and George 1979) contain numerous reproductive females (Smith 1928).  The winged male and female reproductive mate either in the nest or after a nuptial flight (Smith 1965).  Colonies are established by newly mated queens or by budding from pre-existing colonies.  Ants from difference colonies are not aggressive toward one another (Smith 1965).<p>
The duration of each stage of development varies depending on the season of the year: 11 to 26 days for eggs, 13 to 29 days for larvae; two to three days for prepupae, and eight to 25 days for pupae (Smith 1928).<p>
In selecting a nest site, the odorous house ant is opportunistic.  Nests in soil are usually shallow and often located beneath an object such as a board or stone (Smith 1965).  Stacked material such as lumber, firewood, bricks, rocks, and cardboard are also favorite nesting sites.<p> 
When Odorous house ants invade a building, their nests are often located outside.<p>  
Indoors, their nests are usually found associated with moisture, such as within wall voids near pipes and heaters, bathtraps, wood damaged by termites, and beneath toilets (Vail et al. 2003).<p> 
The workers forage both day and night to collect honeydew, one of their favorite foods (Snelling and George 1979).  They also feed on both live and dead insects (Smith 1965).  Smith (1928) noted that indoors, this ant can be active throughout the year and has been seen foraging outdoors at temperatures as low as 50°F.”<p>
