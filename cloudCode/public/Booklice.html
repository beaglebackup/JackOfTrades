<h1>Booklice</h1>

<p>“Booklice
belong to the order Psocoptera, the ptera referring to “wing” and
the psoc referring to the chewing mouthparts of these insects (Arnett
2000).  The number of species of psocids found in North America
varies depending upon the authority consulted.  Most entomolofical
texts use Roesler’s (1944) classification that recognizes 11
families and 150 species, whereas, Arnett (2000) identifies 287
species from 28 families.  Most psocids are outdoor inhabitants,
winged as adults, and commonly found on the bark of trees and shrubs,
thus giving them the common name of barklice.  Several genera and
species seem to specialize in dwelling around human buildings and
food storage areas are often called booklice.  Booklice psocids are
extremely flattened and are common around cracks and crevices, as
well as in the bindings of moldy books.</p>

<p>Booklice range from 1/25 to 1/13 of an inch (1 to 2 mm) in length while some
outdoor, winged barklouse species may be as large as ¼ inch (7 mm). 
The coloration of booklice ranges from almost colorless to gray or
light brown.  Psocids have long, filamentous antennae and a
characteristic bulging clypeus (the area just above the mouthparts). 
They have chewing mouthparts, and the wings of home-infesting species
are usually absent or reduced to small scales.</p>

<p>Development &amp; Behavior.</b> 
All representatives of this order undergo maturation from egg to
adult through a simple a paurometabolous metamorphosis.  All members
have wing tissues present, but most “indoor species” do not
develop full, functional wings.  The cereal psocid, as well as other
species, commonly reproduces parthenogentically (without mating), as
males have not been observed.  Other species, however, even in the
same genus, may have both males and females.  The larger pale trogiid
not only reproduces sexually, but the female actually uses sound to
attract a mate (Pearman 1928a).  
</p>

<p>Many
psocids occur outdoors, on or under bark, grass, leaves, damp wood,
and similar places.  These outdoor species are often referred to as
“barklice.”  Some semitropical psocids spin webbing on tree
trunks or outside house walls, especially where lichens grow, and are
a nuisance in Gulf Coast states (Mockford 1957).  Broadhead and Hobby
(1944) noted that the presence of booklice has been recorded from
houses, warehouses, herbaria, insect collections, libraries, and in
stored foods.  Psocids prefer damp, warm, undisturbed situations. 
They become most numerous in houses during the spring and summer but
are less numerous during winter, likely due to low temperatures and
humidity.</p>

<p>Psocids,
for the most part, feed upon microscopic molds.  Thus, any
manufactured material of plant origin that would support the growth
of these molds would also encourage infestation by booklice.  Psocids
have been observed, however, feeding on starchy foods apparently
foraging upon both the starch source itself and any molds present,
including the starchy paste and flue of book bindings and wall paper.
 Finlayson (1932) observed them in large numbers in soft wheat where
they fed upon the eggs of the Angoumois grain moth, Sitotoga
cerealella (Olivier).</p>

<p>A
number of records exist where these insects have become extremely
abundant in old-fashioned straw mattresses and made life unbearable
by creeping over the walls, food, cupboards, and throughout the
house.  The author was consulted concerning an insect infestation in
a warehouse in Laredo, Texas, where psocids were breeding
prolifically in tow pallets of bagged oats contained tens of
thousands of live psocids.  The oats had been stored in the non-air
conditioned, humid warehouse for more than one year, which allowed
such a population explosion to occur.</p>

<p>Newly
constructed buildings are not immune to infestations of booklice. 
Sudden “blooms” of psocids are possible even within the first few
weeks of finishing construction.  It is believed the moisture of the
plaster and the sizing used to apply wallpaper to some walls as well
as moisture trapped within walls prompts fungus growth, thus allowing
the survival of booklice. 
</p>

<p>Psocids
can be readily introduced to new structures on building material, as
well as upon furniture, boxes, books, and paper.  Once inside the
building. They will be found on the walls, in cupboards where they
can invade cereals and sugar, behind moldings and baseboards, in wall
voids, behind electrical outlets, and sometimes upon the wrappings of
electrical or plumbing, air conditioning elements, and ducts.</p>

<p>Although
psocids may become extremely annoying by crawling over everything in
the house and contaminating food stuffs by their presence, they
usually cause negligible damage to commodities.”
