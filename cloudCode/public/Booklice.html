<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“Booklice belong
to the order Psocoptera, the ptera referring to “wing” and the
psoc referring to the chewing mouthparts of these insects (Arnett
2000).  The number of species of psocids found in North America
varies depending upon the authority consulted.  Most entomolofical
texts use Roesler’s (1944) classification that recognizes 11
families and 150 species, whereas, Arnett (2000) identifies 287
species from 28 families.  Most psocids are outdoor inhabitants,
winged as adults, and commonly found on the bark of trees and shrubs,
thus giving them the common name of barklice.  Several genera and
species seem to specialize in dwelling around human buildings and
food storage areas are often called booklice.  Booklice psocids are
extremely flattened and are common around cracks and crevices, as
well as in the bindings of moldy books.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Booklice range from
1/25 to 1/13 of an inch (1 to 2 mm) in length while some outdoor,
winged barklouse species may be as large as ¼ inch (7 mm).  The
coloration of booklice ranges from almost colorless to gray or light
brown.  Psocids have long, filamentous antennae and a characteristic
bulging clypeus (the area just above the mouthparts).  They have
chewing mouthparts, and the wings of home-infesting species are
usually absent or reduced to small scales.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">DEVELOPMENT &amp;
BEHAVIOR.  All representatives of this order undergo maturation from
egg to adult through a simple a paurometabolous metamorphosis.  All
members have wing tissues present, but most “indoor species” do
not develop full, functional wings.  The cereal psocid, as well as
other species, commonly reproduces parthenogentically (without
mating), as males have not been observed.  Other species, however,
even in the same genus, may have both males and females.  The larger
pale trogiid not only reproduces sexually, but the female actually
uses sound to attract a mate (Pearman 1928a).  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Many psocids occur
outdoors, on or under bark, grass, leaves, damp wood, and similar
places.  These outdoor species are often referred to as “barklice.”
 Some semitropical psocids spin webbing on tree trunks or outside
house walls, especially where lichens grow, and are a nuisance in
Gulf Coast states (Mockford 1957).  Broadhead and Hobby (1944) noted
that the presence of booklice has been recorded from houses,
warehouses, herbaria, insect collections, libraries, and in stored
foods.  Psocids prefer damp, warm, undisturbed situations.  They
become most numerous in houses during the spring and summer but are
less numerous during winter, likely due to low temperatures and
humidity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Psocids, for the
most part, feed upon microscopic molds.  Thus, any manufactured
material of plant origin that would support the growth of these molds
would also encourage infestation by booklice.  Psocids have been
observed, however, feeding on starchy foods apparently foraging upon
both the starch source itself and any molds present, including the
starchy paste and flue of book bindings and wall paper.  Finlayson
(1932) observed them in large numbers in soft wheat where they fed
upon the eggs of the Angoumois grain moth, Sitotoga cerealella
(Olivier).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">A number of records
exist where these insects have become extremely abundant in
old-fashioned straw mattresses and made life unbearable by creeping
over the walls, food, cupboards, and throughout the house.  The
author was consulted concerning an insect infestation in a warehouse
in Laredo, Texas, where psocids were breeding prolifically in tow
pallets of bagged oats contained tens of thousands of live psocids. 
The oats had been stored in the non-air conditioned, humid warehouse
for more than one year, which allowed such a population explosion to
occur.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Newly constructed
buildings are not immune to infestations of booklice.  Sudden
“blooms” of psocids are possible even within the first few weeks
of finishing construction.  It is believed the moisture of the
plaster and the sizing used to apply wallpaper to some walls as well
as moisture trapped within walls prompts fungus growth, thus allowing
the survival of booklice. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Psocids can be
readily introduced to new structures on building material, as well as
upon furniture, boxes, books, and paper.  Once inside the building.
They will be found on the walls, in cupboards where they can invade
cereals and sugar, behind moldings and baseboards, in wall voids,
behind electrical outlets, and sometimes upon the wrappings of
electrical or plumbing, air conditioning elements, and ducts.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Although psocids may
become extremely annoying by crawling over everything in the house
and contaminating food stuffs by their presence, they usually cause
negligible damage to commodities.”
