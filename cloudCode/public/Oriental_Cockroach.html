<h1>Oriental Cockroach</h1>
<h2>Blatta orientalis (Linneaus)</h2>

<p>“The
oriental cockroach is more temperate in origin than most pest species
of cockroach, Cornwell (1968) identified it as originally a native of
Northern Africa.  It is not successful in tropical climates and in
the United States is found only rarely in Florida (Atkinson et at.
1990).  The oriental cockroach prefers temperatures below 84* F
(Cornwell 1968), and it exhibits sufficient cold tolerance to survive
outdoors through temperate winters with access to food and water (le
Patourel 1993).</p>

<p>The
oriental cockroach is so dark brown in color that it is often
referred to as the “black beetle” in both the United States and
England.   Very often this cockroach as well as other species, is
called a “water bug,” possibly because these cockroaches inhabit
damp places.  The adult is one inch (25 mm) in length, and the male
differs in appearance from the female.  The male has fully developed
brownish-black wings covering about 75% of the abdomen, but males do
not fly.  The shiny black female has rudimentary wings that are
reduced to “wing stubs.”  The mature female is distinguished from
the large nymph by the presence of venation on these wing stubs.
Laing (1938) stated the abdomen of the female is broader than the
male and appear to be dragged along the floor when the insect is in
motion, while the male keeps its body clear of a surface when
running.  The male is easily distinguished from the female by the
presence of fully developed wings and by the styli located between
its pairs of jointed cerci.  Females are more numerous than males,
and mating occurs anytime during the year.</p>

<p>This
species often travels through sewer pipes and lives on filth
(anonymous 1957).  It may enter the home in food packages and
laundry, or come in under the door, through air ducts, ventilators,
or garbage chutes.  The species is attracted to wet and shady
perimeter areas and prefers the dark and dampness of basements and
crawlspaces.</p>
<p>The
oriental cockroach prefers temperatures in the range of 68*F to 84*
(Cornwell 1968).  This range is typically cooler than the preferred
temperatures for other cockroach species.  Consequently, the oriental
cockroach may be the sole cockroach inhabitant of cooler basements
and cellars.  Oddly, this cockroach can also tolerate hot, drier
locations if regular access to water is available (Cornwell 1968).</p>

<p>
The female may deposit from one to 18
egg capsules with an average of eight per lifetime.   The egg capsule
is carried from 12 hours to five days and then deposited where food
is readily available.  Rau (1945) showed this cockroach prefers to
fee upon starchy foods.”</p>
