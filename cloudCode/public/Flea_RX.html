“As with most pest problems, control depends on sanitation, source reductions, and exclusion.  Flea larval habitats should be vacuumed to remove organic material (“flea dirt”) service as food, then treated with an insect developmental inhibitor.  Once the animal has been treated with a veterinary product providing sustained flea protection, environmental modification to exclude wildlife and feral animals from the area is needed to prevent flea reinfestation.<p>  

<p><strong>MECHANICAL / PHYSICAL PROCEDURES.</strong>  Mechanical or physical control procedures will be conducted primarily by the homeowner.  Education of the client on important aspects of flea biology is essential if any degree of compliance is expected.  Helpful procedures include having the homeowner wash the pet’s blanket, throw rugs, and pet carrier, and vacuum pet sleeping and resting areas thoroughly to help remove flea eggs, larvae, and dried adult feces.  Seat cushions and pillows on sofas and chairs should be removed and vacuumed as well as crevices in sofas and chairs.  Areas where pets like to sleep or rest are especially important, including under beds and in closets.  It is important that because cats climb, sources of fleas may be found on windowsills and shelving above floor level.<p>

Regular use of a vacuum device with a beater bar not only removes a number of flea eggs and larvae, it also stimulates pre-emerged adult fleas to emerge from cocoons (Osbrink et.al 1986).  Vacuum bags should be discarded in outdoor trash receptacles after vacuuming.<p>

Steps should be taken to exclude pets, raccoons, rats, opossums, squirrels, and other possible flea hosts from entering chimneys, crawlspaces, attics, and beneath porches.  Many times, dogs and other pets that are allowed to seek shade under the house or deck on a hot summer day can lead to a rapid buildup of a heavy concentration of fleas.<p>

<p><strong>CONTROL OF FLEAS ON PETS.</strong>  The most critical factor in long-term relief from flea infestations is treatment of  the pets to stop continued reinfestation of the premises.  In general, such treatments should be conducted by the homeowner under the direction of their veterinarian although many over-the-counter products may be available to pet owners.  Permethrin, fipronil, imidacloprid, and lufenuron are a few of the common active ingredients encountered.  Such products have been so successful that pest management professionals receive vastly fewer calls today to control fleas in homes than before the mid-1990s.  Flea collars also continue to be a popular flea control method although their effectiveness varies.<p>  

Treatment of pets should be completed the same day the home is treated and pets and people should remain out of the house until the treatment has thoroughly dried (or per label directions).<p>

<p><strong>INSECTICIDE TREATMENTS.</strong>  It is important to point out that before the use of any insecticide, the label should be read and thoroughly understood by the applicator.  Insecticides are currently available for flea control inside or outside of buildings.<p>

Successful applications for flea control indoors depend on thoroughness, including treatment of the entire carpeted or rug surface.  Byron and Robinson (1986) highlighted the importance of property maintained equipment and proper application techniques for good flea control.  Control efforts should be focused on those areas frequented by pets and areas where eggs may accumulate, such as in cracks of floor boards, behind baseboards, in ventilators, under edges of carpets, and where larval development is likely.<p>

Successful control of fleas in carpeting is directly related to proper application techniques and application of the proper rate of insecticide.  Thorough coverage by overlapping strokes to areas where fleas may be developing is critical to achieving good penetration and subsequent contact and kill of adult fleas.  Larvae escape most adulticide treatments indoors because the treatment fails to contact them at the base of carpet fibers where they develop, and the larvae require more insecticide per gram of body weight to kill them than adults do (Dryden and Rust 1994).  Therefore, insect growth regulators (IGRs) are highly important in flea control.  Methoprene and pyriproxyfen mimic the activity of juvenile hormone and are classified as juvenile hormone analogs (JHAs).  Juvenile hormone is involved in regulating the molting process of insects.  When insects molt from one larval stage to the next, levels of juvenile hormone are relatively high and are responsible for maintaining larval characteristics.  Continued presence of a juvenile hormone mimic, such as methoprene, results in flea larvae failing to molt into adults, thus interrupting the flea life cycle.  Mehtoprene and pyriproxyfen also have significant ovicidal activity and are effective in on-animal treatments by contacting flea eggs as they are deposited onto and then fall off the animal.<p>

The flea pupa and pre-emerged adult are the life stages most difficult to control in flea programs.  Most flea treatments appear to fail because very few  flea pupae and pre-emerged adults are killed when insecticides are applied to carpets (Rust and Reierson 1989).  These life stages are found inside a silk cocoon within the carpet fiber matrix.  Dryden and Reid (1996) found that cocoons are not a barrier to insecticides.  Survival of developing pupae in insecticide-treated households is not due to any protection afforded by cocoons but because of the lack of penetration of the carpet canopy by the insecticide.<p>

Following the treatment of carpeting and other surfaces, flea pupae will continue to develop and adult fleas will continue to emerge from cocoons for the next two to four weeks (occasionally longer).  While most residual insecticides exhibit activity for several weeks, these compounds generally do not have a quick “knockdown” rate.  Therefore, insecticide causes its death, allowing sufficient time for the fleas to find a dog or cat or client calls for extra service.  Education of homeowners concerning this phenomenon is critical to reduce these “callbacks.”  Homeowners otherwise will assume that the control measures undertaken have failed.  Generally, flea populations will be under complete control within three to five weeks.<p>

<p><strong>CONTROL OF FLEAS OUTDOORS.</strong>  Elimination of fleas in the yard can be an important aspect of flea control, but several important points must be considered.  Those areas protected from direct sunlight and where the soil is moist will provide adequate conditions for flea development (Osbring et al. 1986).  Therefore, flea development outdoors is concentrated in protected microhabitats, such as dog houses, within garages, under porches, and in animal lounging areas beneath shrubs or other shaded areas.”<p>
