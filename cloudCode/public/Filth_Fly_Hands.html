<p><strong>CULTURAL MEASURES.</strong> Practices should be altered or designed to minimize potential breeding sites around buildings. Howard and Bishopp (1926) and Axtell (1994) noted that most adult house flies remain near their breeding habitat where ample larval food and adequate oviposition sites are present. A schedule of regular cleaning and general sanitation is paramount in limiting the numbers of flies in the vicinity of the building,  both by eliminating breeding sites and by attracting fewer flies. Holleman (1992) stated:  "Fly control is rooted in sanitation.&quot; Professionals can help their clients develop deep cleaning schedules and periodic movement of equipment to facilitate removal of built-up food sources that become the breeding site for flies.</p>


<p><h6>1.)Garbage (Food Refuse) Disposal.</h6> Food disposed in trash cans or Dumpsters are  more attractive to flies, so frequent (twice a week) trash pick-up is beneficial for  fly control. Garbage cans without lids or with loose-fitting lids can be major fly breeding source. Ideally, trash and garbage should be stored in a tightly-sealed room either inside, outside, connected to, or adjacent to the main structure. Specially built refrigerated garbage rooms keep fly reproduction in garbage to a minimum.</p>


<p><h6>2.) Trash Disposal System.</h6> Dumpsters should be placed far away from the door as is practical, otherwise flies may gain entrance to the establishment  "en masse" when the back door is opened. Regular clean­ing of the Dumpster and the ground underneath is also 
important in minimizing flies. Placing trash in plastic bags can markedly reduce odors at attract flies.</p>


<p><h6>3.) Animal Manure.</h6> Dog manure in yards is a common source for house flies around homes. Facilities located near farms are often more plagued by flies than similar struc­tures located in cities.</p>


<p><h6>4.) Snail Control Programs.</h6> In some regions of the United States where garden snails are prevalent, efforts to control them may result in large numbers of dead snails resulting in a fly breeding medium.</p>

<p><h6>5.) Adjacent Properties.</h6> Whenever possible and permissible, adjacent properties should be examined for fly breeding sources. Even though it is known that some flies are capable of flying a long distance, typically most, if not all, of the flies found in and around a restaurant or other building originate from fly breeding sources on or near that property.</p>
