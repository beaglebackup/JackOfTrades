<p><h2>Physical &amp; mechanical methods.</h2>  "A variety of control options are available for controlling pigeons, starlings, and sparrows.  They include:<P>

<strong>Habitat modification &amp; sanitation.</strong>  Good sanitation practices, such as removal of spilled food or refuse, can do much to reduce the attractiveness of an area to pigeons.  This depends on the situation and whether or not the food source can be effectively and economically limited.  Where starlings are roosting in street or park trees, selective pruning of smaller, inner perching branches to open up the canopy of the trees may make them unsuitable for roosting cover.<p>

<strong>Exclusion.</strong>  The best and most permanent solution to pigeons and other birds roosting or nesting in or on buildings is to "build them out" by making the site as bird-proof as possible.   Bird exclusion is generally a highly involved process and is situation-dependent; therefore, it cannot be adequately covered in this chapter.  In general, one must survey the bird infestation to determine roosting, loafing, and nesting sites and determine which of the numerous exclusion devices is best suited for each site on the building.  In most cases, more than one method will be necessary.  Additionally, if only the areas of the building where birds are currently active are addressed, the birds may move to another, unprotected areas of the structure.  Likewise, bird populations can be displaced to nearby buildings.<p>

Examples of bird exclusion methods and devices include repellent gels and sprays, bird spikes, wire coils, bird wires, electric shock wiring and tracks, and netting.  Many other unique devices may be available, an example being the Daddi-Long-Legs sold by Bird Barrier, Inc.<p>

Birds entering through openings to nest or roost within a building's attic, false ceiling, etc. should be removed and the openings sealed or repaired permanently.  Birds may be trapped or chased out of such spaces prior to sealing entryways.  Persons working or entering confined spaces used by birds should wear suitable protective equipment (e.g., goggles, gloves, HEPA-equipped respirator) due to the potential presence of pathogens that might be present in accumulated bird feces.  Such accumulations should be removed and the area disinfected using appropriate cleaning and disinfection procedures.  Such procedures may be available on Web sites such as that for the Centers for Disease Control (http://www.cdc.gov).  Companies specializing in services such as cleaning up bird roosts may be available in many markets.<p>

<strong>Harassment &amp; intimidation.</strong>  Nest destruction can be helpful in preventing pigeon and sparrow populations from increasing, but to be effective the nest and eggs must be destroyed at two-week intervals.  Nest removal is most effective when used in conjunction with other types of reductional control.  By itself, unless carried out over a very long period, it has little effect on localized pigeon populations.  However, recolonization by evicted  birds, as well as new arrivals, often will occur on buildings previously cleared unless some other corrective action is taken.  To be efficacious, nest destruction must be continued until natural mortality accounts for the surviving adults.<p>

Starlings can be repelled from night roosts with sound such as pyrotechnics, exploding cracker shells, and recorded starling distress calls.  For best results, such distress calls or noise repellents should be initiated as soon as the birds begin using the location and should be continued until they leave.  Three to four consecutive evenings is generally adequate to displace the birds to roost, hopefully less objectionable.  However, if after six to seven days, the birds have not moved, the technique should be re-evaluated or discontinued.  Scaring must begin early in the evening when the birds first begin to arrive and when there is sufficient light for the starlings to find alternate roosts.  When repelling large numbers of starlings, a risk always exists that the new or alternative site selected by the birds will also be objectionable to humans.<p>

Most visual devices (e.g., plastic owls, scare-eye balloons, metallic-reflective tape and other reflective objects moved by breezes) and auditory-based devices (e.g., electronic distress call emitters) commonly used for scaring away nuisance birds are of only temporary value at best for pigeons and sparrows.  Explosive-type frightening devices, such as shotguns, shell crackers, or pyrotechnics are possible exceptions in dealing with sparrows roosting in trees if used before the birds have habituated to the site.  The longer a roosting site is used, the more difficult it is to displace the birds.  The technique often requires a great deal of persistence to drive sparrows from a site and is only appropriate to rural settings.<p>

<strong>Live-Trapping.</strong>  Live-trapping of pest birds can be highly effective method of control.<p>

Pigeons.  A variety of traps have been used for pigeons, including loft traps, funnel traps, and bob-type walk-in traps.  With few exceptions, the bob-type trap is the most effective.  The size of these traps varies considerably, from being several feet in each dimension, to only 10 inches high and 18 to 24 inches in width and length.  Regardless of size, the bob-type traps all work on the same principle.  The door or entrance through which the pigeons are lured consists of a row of evenly spaced, one-way, free-swinging wire pieces (bobs).  The bobs allow pigeons to push them upward and inward to enter the trap but prevent their exit.  Grain (e.g., wheat, milo, or cracked corn) is scattered at the door entrance to entice the birds into the trap.  One to three live decoy pigeons in the trap greatly improve trapping efficiency.  Water and food have to be provided for the decoys.  Live-catch traps should be serviced frequently to remove captured pigeons (except for decoys).  Various methods are used for disposing of trapped pigeons, but in no case should they be taken away from the area and released, for the pigeons homing ability can defeat any trap and release program.<p>

Starlings.  The modified Australian crow trap with live decoys makes an effective starling trap at feedlots, orchards, and vineyards where starlings are feeding (Zajanc and Cummings 1965).  Traps are not, however, the solution to problems involving large populations at winter roosts.<p>

Sparrows.  A variety of traps have been used to control sparrows, but the funnel trap has been the most popular and, generally, the most effective.  Funnel traps are commercially available or can be constructed from available plans.  They come in a variety of sizes ranging up to 24 inches wide and 6 to 8 feet long, but their basic trapping principle is the same.  The wire mesh trap of 1/4- or 1/2-inch-mesh hardware cloth consists of two compartments; the birds enter the first chamber through a funnel entrance that is at floor level.  In their effort to escape the first compartment, they inadvertently find their way through another small opening which is at the apex of the second funnel that takes them into the holding compartment of the trap.  Escape from this compartment rarely occurs.  The birds can be removed through a small door.  The traps should be serviced regularly and the removed birds destroyed in an acceptable manner.  By providing food and water, several birds can be left in a trap as decoys.  Funnel traps can be used effectively in areas where sparrows are in the habit of feeding.  They can be baited with canary grass seed, cracked wheat, milo, corn, or with chick-scratch feed.  Although it is time consuming, a great many sparrows can be trapped from some locations.  Trapping success often varies dramatically with the season of the year and the availability of food in the vicinity.  Other kinds of sparrow traps are available on the market but few can match a good funnel trap in capture success.<p>

<strong>Shooting</strong>  Shooting, where legal and safe, is another option in pigeon control and for removing a relatively few sparrows from inside large buildings, such as aircraft hangars.  This process is very time consuming if more than just a few birds are involved.  Where permissible, shooting with a .22-caliber rifle with bird shot or short range "BB" can be effective.  Shotguns and high-powered air rifles have also been effectively used for pigeons.  The situation must be appraised carefully to avoid hazards to people, equipment, and buildings.  Public relations must also be considered as many persons might object to direct killing of birds.<p>

<p><h2>CHEMICAL CONTROL.</h2>  Chemical control options for managing sparrows, pigeons, and starlings include:

<strong>Repellents.</strong>  Rejex-It is a nontoxic, taste aversion agent containing methyl-anthranilate that can be used to displace roost of starlings in some situations.  The product is applied using a thermal fogging machine during the evening, early night while starlings are in their roosts.  The product adhering to the feathers is distasteful to the starlings and they may be moved from their roosts.  Repeated applications over several nights is usually necessary for successful displacement of the flock.  Contact the products manufacturer for details on which situations this method might be useful.<p>

<strong>Hallucinogenic &amp; Toxic Baits.</strong>  The hallucinogenic frightening agent Avitrol (4-aminopyridine) is available as a bait or concentrate and is quite effective for pigeon control, but less so for sparrows and starlings.  The product is used as a bait, and starlings generally do not feed at the roosting site.  Sparrows are not easily frightened.<p>

Avitrol is lethal to the birds that ingest sufficient quantities, but prior to death, the affected bird, depending on the species, may display erratic behavior and emit distress cries that, in turn, frighten the other birds in the flock.  The treated bait is diluted with clean, non-toxic train to limit the number of birds that will actually consume a biologically active does.  In this way, by dosing a relatively small number of birds, the material is capable of producing flock-alarm reactions that repel the rest of the birds, the material is capable of producing flock-alarm reactions that repel the rest of the birds from the area.  The dilution rate used has a significant influence on effective results (Martin and Martin 1984).  Prebaiting with whole corn or corn chops is essential to establish pigeon flock feeding behavior prior to baiting with treated grain as well as with sparrows.  Repeated application of bait may be required until the population ceases to return to the area or until an acceptable population level is attained.  After an initial success, bait need only be applied periodically, following prebaiting, to keep pigeons from returning to the area.<p>

With starlings, baiting can be sometimes accomplished on a nearby rooftop or other secure site using the Avitrol concentrate formulation mixed with pieces of bread or French fries.  In rural settings, Avitrol is effective for repelling birds from feeding sites such as cattle feedlots, dairies, and hog and poultry farms.  The lethal avicide Starlicide (3-chloro-p-toluidine hydrochloride) prepared and used as baits, is effective in some situations.  As with Avitrol or trapping, its effectiveness is limited primarily to feeding sites, although some baiting success has been achieved in the birds' pre-roosting staging area.  Contact these products' manufacturers for specific details on proper and successful use in controlling nuisance birds.<p>

In urban situations, consideration must be given to possible adverse public reaction to poisoning birds.  Even though few birds might die following consumption of Avitrol, the perception of finding even one dead pigeon or bird as a result of a pest control company's efforts may result in negative publicity appearing in the local media.  Additionally, many states have restrictions on the use of products such as Avitrol in areas where raptors (e.g., hawks, eagles) occur."<p>
