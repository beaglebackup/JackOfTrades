<h1>Red
Imported Fire Ant </h1>
<h2>RIFA</h2>

<p>
<strong>Identifying Characteristics.</strong> 
“The workers are 1.6 to 5 mm long and polymorphic.  They have a
two-segmented petiole and a stinger.  Their antennae are 10 segmented
with a two-segmented club.  The clypeus has three teeth.  The body
color is an almost uniform dark reddish-brown.  The winged male and
female reproductive (alates) are larger than workers.  Female
reproductive are 8 mm long and similar in color to workers.  Males
are black.</p>

<p><strong>Biology &amp; Habits.</strong>  As
in all ants, the RIFA undergoes complete metamorphosis, which consist
of four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult.  A mature queen can lay
hundreds of eggs each day.  After seven to 10 days, the eggs hatch
into grub-like larvae, and after another one to two weeks, the larvae
molt into quiescent pupal stage.  Pupae resemble curled-up adults and
cannot move.  Over the next one to two weeks, the pupae become either
adult workers or reproductives.  Mature colonies of RIFAs have
200,000 to 300,000 workers, and either one queen (monogyne) or many
queens (Polygyne).</p>

<p>Monogyne
colonies are territorial and reproduce by mating flights.  The males
die after copulating while the newly mated queens seek out nest
sites.  Fire ants are not strong fliers but sometimes can fly miles
before landing.  They are attracted to reflective surfaces such as
pools and truck beds where they will land, and in the latter case
sometimes be transported for hundreds of miles.  In the more typical
case, a newly mated queen lands on the ground, removes her wings, and
then searches for moist, soft soil where she digs a small hole. 
Inside the hole, she seals the entrance and begins laying eggs. 
After one or two years the colony matures and produces large numbers
of alates in preparation for the mating flights in spring.  Mating
flights will take place at other times if the weather is favorable. 
Alates prefer to fly after it rains on warm, clear days with little
wind. 
</p>

<p>Polygyne
colonies are not territorial and may consist of many mounds.  As a
result, they are larger than monogyne colonies and have higher mound
densities.  Polygyne infestations may have hundreds of mounds per
acre, while monogynes have only 30 to 40.  In addition to mating
flights, polygyne colonies can also spread by fission or budding
(Vargo and Porter 1989), an adaptation that may allow them to invade
a location that is unfavorable for mating flights.</p>

<p>The
RIFA has an omnivorous diet and opportunistic feeding habits, and
they feed on any plant or animal they encounter and opportunistic
feeding habits, and they feed on any plant or animal they encounter
(Lofgren et al. 1975).  Their primary diet, however, is insets and
other small invertebrates (Vinson and Greenberg 1986), including some
that are crop pests, such as the cotton boll weevil (Sterling 1978),
sugar cane borer (Reagan 1981), and tobacco budworm (McDaniel and
Sterling 1979, 1982).  They are also scavengers and feed on carrion.</p>

<p>In
heavy infestations, RIFAs saturate the environment and become a
dominant ecological force.  As a consequence, coexisting species of
ants, other invertebrates (Porter and Savignano 1990), and
vertebrates (Lofgren 1986) suffer and are sometimes eliminated.  In
the South, the negative effects of RIFAs on animal diversity are
extensive (Wojcik et al. 2001).</p>

<p>Their
notoriety is due mainly to their aggressive defense of the nest
accompanied by their painful sting, which they are able to inflict in
unison after crawling up the legs of an unwitting victim.  To sting,
each ant must first grab the skin with their mandibles for leverage,
then curl its abdomen to insert the stinger.  The venom contains
piperidines, which cause a burning sensation, and proteins, which can
cause life-threatening anaphylactic shock in a small percentage (less
than 1%) of the population.  The sting causes a white pustule to form
on the skin.”</p>
