<h1>CONTROL OF SMALL FLIES IN STRUCTURES</h1>

<p>
"The key to solving infestations of small flies such as fruit flies or phorid flies, is to find a  of the breeding sources and correct or eliminate them. Insecticide treatments are rarel  needed for these flies except for space treatments to kill remaining adult flies after breeding sources have been removed. Infestations of these flies persist because one or more breeding sources have been overlooked. Because these flies can develop in large numbers from a very small amount of decaying organic matter, this task can be very difficult.  Although a bakery was thoroughly washed each night, flour and moisture collected in cracks under the edge of kitchen equipment at the floor level. Phorid flies were breeding in these cracks by the hundreds. Only by scraping out the fermenting flour, scrubbing the cracks with soap and water, and drying the area with an air compressor was the problem solved (Hedges 1994). The cracks were sealed with a durable caulk to prevent flour from collecting in these areas again.

<p><strong>MOTH FLIES.</strong> The key to eliminating a moth fly infestation in a building is finding and eliminating the breeding sources. Broken pipes under slabs and shower pans, sump pump: floor drains, sewers, and elevator pits are all potential breeding sites within buildings.</p>

<p>
Where the adults occur in enormous numbers in sewage-filter operations, controlling them is then the responsibility of the municipality concerned. Satchell (1947) stated th warmth of sewage beds in winter results in early emergence of the flies and infestation of natural breeding sites, and may lead to heavy infestations later in the year. Headlee (191&lt;; found submergence for 24 hours was destructive to the larvae and pupae. Because the eggs are not affected, the flooding of sewage filter works may have to be repeated at intervals. A pest management professional who attempts to clear psychodids from filter beds or other large areas is urged to determine the federal, state, and municipal regula­tions that must be followed in his or her area to prevent adverse environmental reactions from occurring. The insect growth regulatory (IGR) methoprene recently has been ap­proved for use in sewage facilities to help control flies.</p>

<p>
Mallis and Pence (1941) obtained control of the Pacific drain fly in a washbasin drain by disconnecting the drain and removing the gelatinous lining. This was ac­complished by forcing a paper swab with an outer coating of wax paper through the drain. A curved wire or a plumber&#39;s probe may be used to ram the swab down the drain. Considerable time elapses before the gelatinous lining accumulates in suffi­cient quantity to permit re-infestation of the area.</p>

<p>
Inside commercial buildings such as res­taurants and hospitals, all drains should be checked for fly larvae. This can be done by scraping the film off the side of the drain us­ing a screwdriver or knife. The presence of larvae in the film indicates a breeding source. Drain cleaners generally do not clean drains well enough to kill all the larvae present, so drains should be cleaned using a stiff brush together with a drain cleaner. Bacterial drain products, regularly applied, have proved ef­fective in minimizing drain flies in buildings. Space treatments call be used to kill the adult flies present, but only after breeding sources have been eliminated.</p>

<p>
Sometimes, drainpipes break in crawlspaces or under slab floors. Moth flies begin breeding in the material that leaks out of the pipe. In crawlspaces, the pipe must be fixed, the area dried, and a space treatment applied to kill adult flies. Under slabs, it may be necessary to break a hole in the slab to remove and replace the contaminated soil and repair the break in the pipe.</p>
