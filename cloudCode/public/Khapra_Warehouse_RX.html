<p><strong>CONTROL OF KHAPRA AND WAREHOUSE BEETLES.</strong> For T. granarium, warehouses are fumigated for 24 hours with 4 to 12 pounds (1.8 to 5.4 kg) dosage of methyl bromide per 1,000 cubic feet (28 cubic meters), the dosage rate depending on the temperature and the commodity.  The fumigated buildings are wrapped in gas-tight tarpaulins and tightly sealed.  The ground surrounding an infested building may also be treated with an appropriate residual insecticide following fumigation.  Control of T. variabile can be accomplished with lower dosages of fumigants as well as a variety of residual dusts, liquid applications and contact insecticides.  Trogoderma beetles are more difficult to control with extreme temperatures than other stored pests.</p>
