<p><strong>CULTURAL CONTROL.</strong><p>
Sanitation improvement.<p>
Storage of food items in sealable containers.<p>
Increase frequency of waste removal.<p>
Maintaining food items in designated areas (away from work stations).<p>
Education on irrigation practices.<p>
Education of preferred landscape materials ie. landscape cloth vs. sheet mulching, type of plants that reduce attributing insects (aphids), honeydew secreting plants.<p> 


<p><strong>MECHANICAL &amp; PHYSICAL CONTROL</strong>
Removal with soapy water and sponge<p>
Vacuuming indoor trails<p>
Flooding of potted plants where nest have been made<p>
Permanent sticky barriers (tanglefoot)<p> 
Sealants of cracks and crevices<p>
Expansion foam around pipes<p>

<p><strong>CHEMICAL CONTROL</strong><p>
<strong>Ant baiting using liquid ant bait: EXTERIOR</strong><p>
The main advantage of using liquid ant bait is its relatively slow mode of action in killing ants. The “ideal” liquid ant bait will allow foraging ant scouts to locate the bait and return to their nest mates before the active ingredients kills them its also known as the “sweet spot”.<p>

The advantage of liquid bait stations is that you are providing abundance of food to the ants by placing large amounts of bait in various locations along their trails. When there is abundance of food ants will send more scouts and worker ants to the source to collect it and more of the active ingredients in the bait enters the nest sites. Bait stations also maintain the composition of the bait by protecting it from evaporation and preventing the concentration of active ingredients to increase resulting in less effective baiting program. 
The placement of liquid ant bait station is also best on the exterior of the building where ants are present. By placing the baits at the exterior you attract ants away from structures and maintain them outside while the active ingredients take effect.<p> 

The bait stations will periodically need to be relocated as you eliminate ant trails and nest. Each bait station can gradually be moved away from the structure to entice ants to move outward. Eventually over time you may be able to maintain ants foraging to the perimeter of the property.<p>   
 
<p><h4>GEL BAIT: Exterior</h4>
Gel bait works best as a “trail killer” or for small ant infestations if the placement of liquid ant stations is not possible.<p> 
Gel baits tend to lose their attractiveness and can become concentrated with evaporation hence they lose the effectiveness at eliminating ant nest.<p> 
However when using small application of gel ⅛”in  spots every 1-2’ along the expansion of the ant trail it has been know to show effectiveness in eliminating ant trails.<p> 

<p><h4>GRANULAR BAIT: Exterior</h4>
Ants foraging behavior changes seasonal and ants need an assortment of food choices to survive the season.  Granular baits add variety of choices for ants who are searching for either carbohydrates or protein.<p>   
Granules are also useful for areas that have plenty of ant scouts but don’t have a defined trail or nest site.<p> 

<p><h4>DUST: Exterior or interior</h4>
Diatomaceous earth is best indoor within cracks and crevices, points of entry, around pipes in wall voids and behind electrical outlets. The application of D.E. in the mentioned areas creates a barrier and temporarily repels ants outwards. Once the ants begin to move outward a placement of a bait station can attract ants to stay outside.<p> 

<p><strong>BIOLOGICAL CONTROL</strong>
Pyemotes mites, have been successful on fire ants and carpenter ants however they can become temporary pest of humans and may not be suitable near structures or near people. (Common sense pest control, pg. 237 “Direct Biological controls”)<p>


<p><strong>CONTROL TIPS.</strong>  “The seasonal pattern of Argentine ant infestations in the urban environment varies regionally.  In California, for example, they are cool-season pests in northern regions and predominantly summer pests in southern regions.  Ideally, chemical control should be applied early in the season when the ant colonies are undergoing rapid growth, and acquisition of an adequate food supply is critical for the colony’s success.  By stunting colony growth early in the season, the professional can inhibit colony development, resulting in lower numbers of ants later in the season.  Applications of residual insecticides or toxic baits are the primary methods of controlling Argentine Ants.<p>

To be an effective barrier to Argentine ants, a residual insecticide must be applied thoroughly (Rust and Knight 1990) as bands along the foundation; along the margins of sidewalks and pathways; around stepping stones, base of trees, potted plants, and garbage cans; and in places likely to harbor ant nests.  At maximum label rates, a thorough application of a pyrethroid product can provide eight to 10 weeks of control (Klotz et al. 2002); however the repellency of some will occasionally trap ants indoors, requiring additional treatment (Rust et al. 1996).<p>

Ideally, the application of baits should also commence early in the seasonal life cycle of Argentine ants, when egg production is at its peak.  Protein-based baits could potentially be effective at this time (Rust et al. 2000).  The commingling of ants between nests makes Argentine ants particularly amenable to bait treatment.  Markin (1968) estimated that in five days the exchange of ants between neighboring nests is more than 50% of the worker population.  Thus, bait consumed by ants from one nest will be gradually spread into surrounding nests.<p>

Unfortunately, most of the commercial baits available for ant control either are not attractive to Argentine ants or kill them too quickly (Rust et al. 2002).  Under current development, however, are liquid baits, which look promising for Argentine ant control (Rust et al. 2002).  The baits contain new active ingredients that are effective at low concentrations.  A variety of bait stations are available for applying liquid ant baits.  Argentine ants are particularly amenable to liquid bait formulations because the workers’ diet consists primarily liquid foods (Markin 1970c), and their digestive tract and behavior are specialized for handling liquids (Hoolldobler and Wilson 1990).<p>

The foraging range and behavior of Argentine ants poses a problem for baiting programs.  Vega and Rust (2003) used dyes in sucrose water to determine that the foraging range of Argentine ants is >60 meters.  In urban environments this may encompass several homes, which would require area-wide control programs.<p>

Due to resource and site fidelity of foraging Argentine ants, another challenge is how to redirect them from an established trail to a bait (Fernandes and Rust 2003).  A piece of string can be placed along an ant foraging trail to guide ants into a bait station.<p>

A pheromone-enhanced guideline, such as a string treated with synthetic trail pheromone (Z9-16:Ald) may even draw more ants off a trail and into a bait station.<p>

Vega and Rust (2001a) provide a comprehensive review of treatment strategies for Argentine ants, both chemical and nonchemical.  In addition, promising new research on the toxicity and repellency of aromatic cedar mulch to Argentine ants suggests its use in urban IPM programs (Meissner and Silverman 2001, 2003).  Landscaping mulches, such as pine straw, provide ideal nesting sites for ants.  In contrast, cedar mulch is not only repellent to Argentine ants but lethal when they travel across it.”<p>
