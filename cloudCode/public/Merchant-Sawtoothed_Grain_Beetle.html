sawtoothed grain beetle is cosmopolitan in distribution.  This beetle
attacks cereals, dried fruits, breakfast foods, macaroni, sugar,
drugs, dried meats, chocolate, tobacco, snuff, bran, rolled oats,
brown rice, and walnuts, flour, meal, and other processed foods.  It
will infest figs and other dried fruits after prolonged storage.  It
readily invades packaged foodstuffs.  The beetles and larvae have
been known to enter every single package in a heavily infested
grocery store.  The insects soon became so abundant, it was necessary
to suspend business.</font></p>

and Lacey (1996) reported on a case in a home where this insect was
found by the tens of thousands in a garage, originating from a large

 The sawtoothed grain beetle is a small, active brown beetle about
1/10 inch (2.5 mm) in length.  Its flattened body is well adapted for
crawling into crevices.  The margins of the thorax are saw-like,
bearing six projections on each side, and are the reason for its
common name.  The male can be distinguished from the female by the
fact that it bears a tooth on the femur of the hind leg.  The wings
are well developed, but no record exists of the beetle being observed
to fly.  A closely related species, the merchant grain beetle,
Oryzaephilus Mercator (Fauvel), resembles the sawtoothed grain beetle
and is known to fly.  The merchant grain beetle has larger eyes than
the sawtoothed grain beetle, which makes the canthus area of the head
(directly behind the eyes) small and pointed.</font></p>

<font color="#1f497d"><font face="Avenir Book, serif"><b>LIFE
HISTORY.</b></font></font><font face="Avenir Book, serif">  The eggs
are laid singly or in small batches and are deposited into some
crevice in the food supply.  Eggs may also be deposited in finely
found foods, such as flour or meal.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">The
larva is yellowish-white and has a brown head.  When fully grown, it
is a little less than 1/8 inch (3 mm) in length.  The larva thrives
on foodstuffs of vegetable origin, such as rice and wheat, breakfast
foods, chocolate, and nutmeats.  Merchant grain beetles occur more
often in seeds or grains high in fats and oils, like peanuts, and
birdseeds.  The sawtoothed grain beetle moves about nibbling hither
yon, and probably cannot feed on the whole grain.  It is therefore
more often associated with other insects that feed on intact grain or
in food products made from processed grains. </font>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">The
larva molts from two or four times, depending upon temperature.  Six
to seven generations may occur annually.  In general, development is
more rapid at higher humidities; however, the egg and pupal stages
appear to be affected little by atmospheric moisture conditions.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">The
insect will cease breeding during the winter unless the building is
heated and moisture conditions are satisfactory.  They may then breed
at a slow rate throughout the winter.  Since most heated buildings
are fairly dry, little or no breeding takes place by the adults
remain active.”</font></p>
