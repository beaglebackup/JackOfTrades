<p><strong>Control of the itch mite.</strong>  "People who suspect being infected by the itch mite should be examined by a physician, preferable a dermatologist.  Medicines are available by prescription from a medical professional.  In no case, however, should the pest management professional attempt to administer topical applications of the prescription medicines.  Sanitation is the best defense against the infection by this mite.  Linens and clothing should be washed on the hot cycle or, if necessary due to type of clothing, thorough dry cleaning can also be effective.  Treatment of the premises is not necessary or recommended as this mite lives only on the host and is transmitted by person-to-person contact."<p>
