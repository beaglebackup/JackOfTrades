“The brown recluse spider, Loxosceles reclusa, is one of 13 Loxosceles species now known to occur in the United States (Breene 1997b).  At the beginning of the 20th century, only two species were recorgnized – L. rufescens and L. unicolor (Comstock 1912).  Gerstsch and Emnick (1983) reported that the brown spiders of the genus Loxoceles (also known as violin or fiddle-back spiders because of the violin-shaped marking on the carapace of some species) are known from two principal world areas: temperate South Africa northward through the tropics into the Mediterranean region and southern Europe; and temperate and tropical zones of North and South America.<p>
In the United States, the brown recluse spiders, L reclusa Gertsch & Mulaik, is considered to be the most widespread and most important species of this group.<p>  
<p><strong>Distribution.</strong>  The natural range of the brown recluse spider, L. reclusa is from southern Texas north to Nebraska, and east to eastern Tennessee and Alabama.  It appears to be most highly concentrated in the south-central portion of the Mid-West.  Although reports of brown recluse spiders outside its natural range from Maine to California have occurred, these are more likely due to transport of commerce or domestic household goods.   In California, fewer than 10 cases of L. reclusa have been confirmed  (Vetter 2000b).  Specimens collected in California are usually the desert recluse, L. deserta, whose presence inside buildings is less common and whose bite is less toxic.<p>
In addition, many misidentifications of brown recluse spiders occur in the absence of a specimen simply based upon examination of wounds in skin.  Physicians may be too quick to decide that an open ulcerous wound is the result of a brown recluse spider bite, even in those areas where this species is not known to occur:  Such misidentifications “can lead to delays in appropriate care” if specific treatments are available for the actual cause of the would (Vetter 2002a).<p>
Within its range, the brown recluse naturally occurs in outdoor situations, living in piles of debris, utility boxes, wood piles, and vehicles, as well as under bark, logs, and stones.  It has adapted quite well to indoor habitats where it is commonly found harboring in storage areas, such as closets, attics, crawlspaces, cellars, and other dark recesses.  They frequently inhabit clothing, boxes, toys, papers, furniture, and other household items and seem to prefer “layered” situations, such as stacks of items or clutter.<p>
<p><strong>Preying Habits.</strong>  The brown recluse spiders are nocturnal and search for food such as silverfish, cockroaches, crickets, or other soft-bodied species.  At first light, wandering spiders will normally return to their retreat of an irregularly spun, off-white web with their prey.  Males wander farther than females (Hedges and Lacey 1995) and are the sex that most commonly crawls into shoes, trousers, or other clothing; or under sheets and covers on beds.  Bites occur when a spider hiding in clothing or bedding is accidentally trapped against the skin.  The thin, wispy webs of the brown recluse may be seen in drawers, boxes, shelf, corners, under furniture, or other disturbed areas.<p>
<p><strong>Life History.</strong>  Hite et al. (1966) studied the life history of the brown recluse spider.  After mating, which may occur from February to October within its natural range, 40 to 50 eggs are deposited in off-white, round, ¼-inch (6 mm) diameter silken cases.  The summer months of May through August are optimal times for egg production.  From one to two years; however, four to five years is not uncommon.  The presence of shed skins (exuviae) and subsequent attachment in and around residences may be indicative of infestations and enable accurate identification.  They are relatively long-lived, averaging a two- to four-year life span (Vetter 2000b).  Additionally, the brown recluse is “synanthropic” which means its numbers increase when living within human  dwellings (Vetter and Hedges 2001).  When one brown recluse is found, numerous spiders usually can be located by visual inspection or the use of monitoring traps.<p>
<p><strong>Recognition of Brown Recluse Spiders.</strong>  Most Loxosceles possess the characteristic dark brown violin marking on the dorsal carapace, but in some species or individual specimens this marking may be faded or absent.  Six eyes are situated in three pairs arranged in a semicircle pattern.  The body coloration of the brown recluse spider varies from yellowish to light tan to dark brown and is covered with a fine pubescence.  The spiderlings resemble adults in structure but have somewhat lighter coloration and may lack the violin-shaped marking on the carapace.”<p>
