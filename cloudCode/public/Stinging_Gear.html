<p><strong>MATERIALS.</strong> The applicability of specific classes and brands of insecticides for controlling various wasps and bees may vary from state to state and from year to year. Product development and label changes occur too rapidly to allow specific products to be name here if the recommendations are to remain current. Insecticides are, therefore, suggest, in terms of the formulations proven to be most effective for the situations being a, dressed. Historically, carbamate insecticides (e.g., propoxur, carbaryl) typically providing quicker knockdown in controlling wasps and bees. Organophosphates (e.g., chlorpyrifc malathion) demonstrate good results with a slightly decreased knockdown time. As &#39; 2002, these latter two classes of insecticides, however, are not readily available for use the U.S. Pyrethrins and pyrethroids (e.g., permethrin, tetramethrin, esfenvalerate, cytluthri cypermethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, tralomethrin, deltamethrin) are currently available. These materials usually require more time for knockdown to occur except when high synergized and delivered with petroleum distillates in directed contact applications. Insecticide dusts have the advantage of being easily and widely distributed by the movement of the insects as they enter and move about in concealed nests. Water-based applications, however, kill only those individuals which contact the exposed, treated surfaces</p>

<p><strong>EQUIPMENT.</strong> Pest management professionals who plan to perform wasp and bee control should be equipped with the following basic equipment and provided training in its proper use and maintenance: light-colored, heavy coveralls or a bee suit; high-sleeve canvas or leather gloves; and helmet or bonnet with secure-fitting veil are necessary prevent against bee or wasp attacks and possible stings. Persons who experience mild severe reactions to insect stings should avoid performing any bee and wasp services.</p>

<p> A hand duster and electric-powered mist and dust injection devices are ideal for close up work. A cordless electric drill and a set of high-speed drill bits will facilitate treatments through sheetrock, plywood, and sheet metal. Extension wands for compressed air sprayers and dusters or aerosol can holders on extension poles are useful for treating exposed nests and entrances to concealed nests. An extension ladder and/or three-hinged scaffold ladder will permit reaching wasp nests and bee nests in trees and upper levels of structures. Tree branch pruning tools and scrapers with telescoping handles are handy for removing exposed paper and mud nests from trees and structures. Exclusion materials may include duct tape, copper gauze, spackle, caulk (white and clear), and cement patch mix. It is important that the outside entrance to a nest located inside a building not be sealed until the nest has been confirmed as dead. Otherwise, bees or wasps could be sealed within the house, resulting in additional problems.</p>

<p>
Most bee and wasp nests can be treated successfully during the day if the proper equipment is worn and precautions taken by the pest management professional. Any bee or wasp colony located far above the ground or in a hard-to-reach location should be treated at night when most of the insects are in the nest. Always move slowly to attract as little attention as possible.</p>
