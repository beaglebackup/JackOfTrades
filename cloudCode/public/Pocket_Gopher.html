<h1>Pocket Gopher </h1>
<h2>(Thomomys bottae) </h2>

<p><strong>Background Information.</strong> Pocket
gophers are also known as ground squirrels. They use their large
front claws and incisors to dig into the ground. They are able to
close their mouth around their teeth so they are able to dig without
getting dirt into their mouths. 
</p>

<p><strong>Distribution &amp; Habits.</strong> Gophers
burrow in the ground and prefer loose, deep soil with vegetation.
They are commonly found in fields, parks and lawns. Burrows are
comprised of a main tunnel with various lateral tunnels off-shooting
from the main one. Burrows can go as far down in the soil as 5 to 6
feet and contain 200 yards of tunnels. Mounds of soil are the most
common way to identify burrows from the soil surface. These burrows
are typically only inhabited by one animal, except during mating
season when the female is with her young. 
</p>

<p><strong>Identification.</strong> Gophers are range
from 5 to 14 inches in length, with males being larger than females.
The range in color from nearly black, to brown, to almost white. They
weigh an average of 3-20 ounces.  
</p>

<p><strong>Life Cycle.</strong> Females
become sexually receptive in the spring after they are born and may
produce 1-2 litters per year. Females can have 1-10 offspring per
litter, but typically average 3-4. The young are weaned at about 4-5
weeks. Gophers live on average from 1 to 3 years. 
</p>

<p><strong>Feeding Behavior.</strong> Gophers
are herbivores. They use their large incisors to chew grasses, roots,
trees or shrubs. Most of their food items are found while digging
their burrows, although they will travel short distances from their
burrows. They are called pocket gophers because of the pouches on
either side of their mouth they use to hold and carry food items.
They are diurnal, active during the day.</p>

<p><strong>Health Concerns.</strong> The most
common problem related to gophers is the destruction they cause to
landscaping, vegetation and underground utilities.
