â€œMoles are notorious for the damage they cause to sod nurseries, golf courses, parks, cemeteries, residential lawns, ornamental planting beds and gardens as a result of their digging and tunneling in search of turfgrass insects and earthworms upon which to feed.  The eastern mole, Scalopus aquaticus, is the most common and damaging mole encountered in these habitats.<p>
