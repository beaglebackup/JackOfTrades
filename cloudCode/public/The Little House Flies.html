<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">“<font face="Avenir Book, serif">The
five main species of little house flies belonging to the genus Fannia
are similar in appearance and habitat to the house fly but differ in
being appreciably smaller and having distinctive wing venation.  The
males are commonly found inside building, particularly those that are
air conditioned, when outside temperatures rise above 80*F.  Males
fly about in the rooms for extended periods of time and seldom rest,
while the females rarely enter buildings and typically fly for only
short periods of time. </font>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Eggs
are usually deposited on decaying vegetable matter or excrement of
several species of animals.  The eggs hatch in 24 to 36 hours, and
the resulting larvae appear as flattened elongate-ovate organisms
with lateral protuberances that are feathered in Fannia scalaris
(F.).  The other species are not as clearly marked.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">These
flies may cause intestinal myiasis in man and possibly may transfer
pathogenic organisms.  Smart (1943) noted the flat spiny maggots “are
very characteristic and are to be found in the dired parts of manure
heaps and other places where there is decaying organic matter.” 
Ehmann, in 1955, surveyed chicken-egg-producing establishments in the
San Fernando Valley of Southern California.  The hens were confined
to rows of cages about 3 feet off of the ground.  Their manure piled
up in cone-shaped mounds beneath them with water from the cages
creating a perfect larval habitat for lesser house fly larvae. 
Breaking off the top of a cone revealed thousands of latrine fly
larvae, Fannia scalaris (F.).</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Hewitt
(1914) found the little house fly, Fannia canicularis (L.), to
commonly breed in human excrement, and that next to the house fly, it
was the most common fly found in homes in the early 1900s.  Recycling
centers that receive mulch, grass clippings, and leaf litter may
harbor and produce huge populations of little house flies.</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">Lewallen
(1954) studied the life history of this fly at 80*F and 65% relative
humidity.  The egg stage requires 36 to 40 hours, the larval stage
eight to 10 days, and the pupal stage eight to 12 days.  The complete
life cycle is 24 to 29 days.  Steve (1960) had results somewhat
similar to those by Lewallen.</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><font face="Avenir Book, serif">The
latrine fly is very similar in appearance and life history to the
little house fly and shows a preference for human excrement.  It is
known to cause intestinal myiasis in humans.  Hewitt (1914) showed
how to separate this species from the little house fly by the rounded
protuberance of the median point of the middle pair of legs of the
latrine fly.”</font></p>
